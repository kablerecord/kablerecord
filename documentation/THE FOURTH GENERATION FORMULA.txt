To My Kids
Mason, Logan, Matix, Ella, Jane 
I need you to know something: I love you. Every word in this book, every early morning writing, every story I've shared—it's all because I love you more than I can express.
My job as your father isn't to make your life easy. It's to make you capable. To create men and women who don't just survive but thrive. Who bring good to a world that desperately needs it. Who see problems and develop solutions. Who add value wherever they go.
I can't dig your ditches for you. Can't make your 2 AM choices. Can't build your pyramid. But I can make sure you know how to dig. How to choose. How to build.
That's what these principles are—not rules from Dad, but tools for life. My love made tangible. My way of being there, even when I'm not.

Author's Note 
This book started as a list of rules for my oldest son for him to continue living at home after high school. Many iterations later, I landed on this final version. Somewhere along the way, I realized that other people could also benefit from reading this book. So, while I wrote this book for my children, I'm excited that you're reading it, and I am hopeful that it will help you in some way. Every story, every principle, every hard-won lesson—they're my attempt to compress forty-five years of building into something my kids can carry forward. 
The truths I uncover in the book aren't just my truths. They're the same principles every successful builder discovers, whether they're building businesses, skills, or character. The struggles change, but the solutions stay remarkably consistent. 
While you'll hear me talking directly to my kids throughout these pages, I invite you to listen in. Adopt what works. Argue with what doesn't. Share the stories that resonate. Because the harsh reality is that 97% of family businesses fail by the fourth generation, and it's not just about money—it's about the failure to transfer capability  
While some debate the exact percentage—whether it's 97%, 95%, or 90%—the reality remains stark: the vast majority of family businesses fail to transfer the builder's mindset across generations successfully. 
Whether you're a parent trying to prepare your children, a mentor developing your team, or someone simply trying to build something that outlasts you, these principles apply. The fourth generation isn't just about bloodlines—it's about anyone you're counting on to carry forward what you've built. 
Read this as if we're having coffee together, and I'm sharing what I wish someone had told me twenty years ago. Because in the end, we're all trying to solve the same problem: how to transfer the ability to build, not just what we've built. 
The stories are mine. The struggles were real. But the principles? Those belong to anyone willing to use them. Let's build something that lasts.

Introduction 
I was standing in the grocery store, spreadsheet in hand, comparing the price of peanut butter between Walmart and Sam's Club. We would drive to whichever store saved us thirty cents. That's when it hit me: This is not who I want to be. There's too much money in the world for me not to have more of it. There's too much to build, too many problems to solve, too many generations counting on me to settle for spreadsheets over strategy. 
Optimizing grocery savings wasn’t what I was meant to do—I was meant to build things that outlast me—but knowing that and living it? That took me twenty more years of growth and learning, two decades I'm hoping to save you.  
“Impossible goals aren't about math—they're about who you have to become” 
Four months before starting to write this book, I did something that the old me would have called crazy. I wrote down an impossible goal: $100 million net worth in 5 years. On paper, the math doesn't work. But I learned impossible goals aren't about math—they're about who you have to become. It’s about creating goals that stretch you, and those goals should scare you at least a little. This book isn't about helping you save on groceries. It's about changing your legacy
The principles in this book aren’t just my observations; they’re time-tested foundations. Every successful builder discovers them eventually. We all have our own journey of learning — sooner or later, these principles show up. The real question is: will you be ready to use them?
Who Am I to Write This Book? 
If I waited until I thought I was ready to write a book, I'd probably never write it. I'm your father. It's my duty to lead you. The day I decided to have kids is the day I took on that responsibility. I don't get to slack off or blame others. I will do my best, I will not fail, I will not quit. 
Why This Book Exists 
I'll be honest—I wasn't sure I had a book in me. Professional book writers (not me) say you need two things: good stories and something worth teaching. I kept wondering if my life was interesting enough. Would stories about concrete jobs, failed inventions, and learning to be less of a robot help you? 
Then I realized that's precisely the point. These aren't tales of overnight success or brilliant moves. They're stories of figuring it out as I went, making mistakes that now seem apparent, and slowly learning lessons that took me way too long to see. 
My goal is to find a balance between laughter and punishment, work and play. Knowing that there is no growth without struggle makes it interesting. If I go too easy on you, then you will fail in life. If I go too hard, maybe you won't invite me to Thanksgiving! 
How This Book Works
This book builds like a foundation - each chapter stacks on the previous one. Master the mindset principles first, and everything else becomes easier to implement.
The lessons come through stories because that's how life teaches - through experience, not lectures. While I use business examples (it's what I know), these principles work the same whether you're transferring a company, a craft, or character to the next generation.
A master carpenter teaching an apprentice faces the same challenge as a CEO grooming a successor: How do you transfer capability, not just knowledge?
The Builder's Formula
After 35 years of building, failing, and rebuilding, I've discovered that every successful builder—from David facing Goliath to my dad pouring concrete— follows the same formula. I call it The Builder's Formula. We will define it fully in chapter 10, but here is a preview of what it is.
IDENTITY - They decide who they are and live from that truth  ACTION –  They  start  before  they're  ready  PERSISTENCE - They never stop moving forward 
Every story in this book will show you these principles in action, sometimes one at a time, sometimes all three at once. Watch for them. By Chapter 10, you'll see how they work together to make success inevitable. 
Think of it this way: The pyramid I'm about to show you? That's WHAT to build. The Builder’s Formula? That’s HOW to build it. You can't construct a pyramid without tools, and you can't build a legacy without mastering these three Elements.
The Formula You’ll Probably Ignore
   I just handed you the complete formula for success. Three simple tools, proven every time they’re applied. So simple you could teach them to a 10-year-old.
Yet most people will nod, agree — and then do nothing. They’ll complicate it, tinker with it, or convince themselves it won’t work for them.
But when you ignore proven foundations, the result is always the same: cracks, failures, starting over. That’s why 97% of family businesses don’t make it to the fourth generation.
Ignore this formula, and five years from now you’ll still be searching for the “real” secret — and your kids will still be watching you struggle with the same patterns.
Your Decision
So what's it going to be? Give me an hour. Read Chapter 1. Imagine being in that hole at 2 AM, when everything's going wrong, and you have to decide who you really are, because that moment is coming for all of you. Probably more than once.
When it does, you'll have these foundations to choose from. Tools tested in the field, not the classroom. Wisdom earned in work boots, not lecture halls.
Time to start building. —Dad



Chapter 1: 
Who You Are at 2 AM 
In times of distress or uncertainty, there is a special breed of person ready to face any challenge and prepared to accomplish any mission—a common human with an uncommon desire to succeed, forged by adversity. I am that person. 
—From The Builder's Creed 
I was standing in a hole at 2 AM, covered in concrete dust and hydraulic fluid, staring at a giant slab of concrete that nothing we had with us could budge. We were twenty hours into a job that was already destroying us. The jackhammer was dead. We'd broken through the plant’s main sewer line, which we wouldn’t discover until the next day. Every hour we delayed cost the client tens of thousands of dollars.  
We had reached a point where we realized we didn't know how to succeed. 
But let me back up, because to understand why that moment mattered—why, in fact, any moment matters—you need to understand something about belief. Not the motivational poster kind of belief. The sort of belief that keeps you moving when your body quits and your mind screams ‘Stop!’. 
The El Paso Education 
It was August 2012. We'd just landed a contract with a company named RockTenn, a massive corrugated cardboard box manufacturer with a plant in El Paso. They made boxes for Amazon, pizza companies, UPS—the kind of operation where downtime meant disaster. The job seemed straightforward: rip out 3,000 square feet of concrete floor, excavate, and pour a new 24-inch deep foundation for their corrugator equipment. One hundred sixty cubic yards of concrete, over half a million pounds, had to be put back. We had been given ninety-six hours to complete our portion of the project. That meant that as soon as plant production stopped, we would start and then work around the clock until the job was completed. 
Your grandpa had bid $115,000 for the job. He did all the quoting at the time. He should have bid $135,000, maybe even $150,000. But we were hungry and looking to grow into the industry. This job was our first big shot at it. That hunger would stretch us to our limits. 
Most of the floor was standard 6-inch concrete. Easy money. But there was this one section—12 by 24 feet of 20-inch reinforced concrete that Thor himself might have as well forged. We flew in from Phoenix on Thursday night: me, your grandpa (52 years old and still outworking guys half his age), Uncle Jake, and some hired hands. The plan was military precise: start Saturday morning at 7, work around the clock, pour Monday morning, clean up on Tuesday,  then fly home like conquering heroes. 
You know how the best laid plans can go sideways? Well, ours went sideways, then upside down, then inside out. 
WHEN EVERYTHING GOES WRONG AT ONCE 
We should have known trouble was coming when they were four hours late giving us the floor. We were supposed to start at 7 AM on Saturday, but it ended up being 11 AM. Four hours of meticulously planned work, gone. They certainly weren't going to give us four extra hours on the back end. We should have stopped right there and renegotiated, but we were hungry and this was our shot. 
We had two backhoes ready to attack that concrete. Smaller than we'd ever bring now, but we thought they were enough at the time. Everything hinged on one piece of equipment—the hydraulic hammer on the main backhoe. The success of our company, our reputation, this entire job—it all came down to that hammer working. 
I hit the button. The hammer made a sound like thunder as it touched the concrete, impressive and powerful. Then... nothing. All noise, no action. Just bounced around on the surface like a kid's toy against granite. The silence after it died was worse than the noise. You know that ringing in your ears after a concert? Like that, but mixed with the sound of money burning. Twenty inches of steel-reinforced concrete, and our primary weapon was shooting blanks. 
Let me tell you something that we already knew before going into the job: You are what you say you are. We had told RockTenn we were problem solvers who could handle anything, including the foundation we were building. The future of our company was riding on proving that true. The engineer was putting his reputation on the line, too. He had taken a chance on us: a small company from out of state. His whole project hinged on our ability to deliver on our promises. 
One thing we've always been good at is improvising. It's why we were there to begin with. While we were grossly inexperienced and in way over our heads, we were—are—good at figuring things out. So I started wielding that useless hammer like a battle axe. I'd lift it high in the air, jam the controls down, and smash it into the concrete with every pound of force I could squeeze out of that backhoe. Lift. BANG. Lift. BANG. 
The other operator watched for any crack, any weakness. When I'd create the tiniest gap, he'd wedge his bucket in and pry with everything he had. Two guys turning construction equipment into medieval siege weapons because the modern tools had failed us. At some point late into the night, we peeled the three-foot backhoe bucket apart like a banana. The teeth and the bottom of it ripping the welds as it folded back. Now all we had was one 12” bucket. 
No one was coming to save us. We were in another town on a Saturday. No rental places open. No backup equipment available. Just us, two undersized backhoes, and 3,000 square feet of concrete that needed to be replaced by Monday morning. 
By 2 AM Sunday—19 hours in—Grandpa had gone to the hotel. The plant had grown quiet; everyone had gone home for the weekend. A few hours earlier, the backhoe with the hydraulic breaker had a line that exploded. If you've never seen hydraulic fluid at 3,000 PSI, imagine a garden hose if angry wasps designed garden hoses. Hot fluid everywhere, mixing with concrete dust to form this gritty paste that found every exposed inch of skin. No more battle axe! We had to limp it over out of the way, fluid pouring out of it like a horrific battle wound in some B sci-fi movie. Now we were down to one backhoe. 
It was just me and your uncle Jake trying our best. He was running the saw, "old blue," we call it. A tiny 16 hp saw that could only cut 6 inches deep. As a comparison, the saw we have today weighs 2000 lbs. and is 75 horsepower of concrete-slicing muscle. It will cut 20 inches deep with a 42-inch blade. It's a beast! But that night, he was focused on one specific problem—that 12x24-foot section of 20-inch reinforced concrete. The Thor slab. He was trying desperately to weaken it with a saw that could only scratch the surface, like trying to cut down a redwood with a pocket knife. 
It had become clear that this slab was going to be our roadblock. Our tools were enough to wrestle the rest of the concrete out the door, but this monster was immovable. While Jake kept cutting, hoping to find any weakness, I was clawing at the surrounding concrete with our remaining backhoe—lifting one end of giant chunks into the air, then dropping them, hoping they'd crack on impact. When that didn't work, I'd try prying them apart. Some pieces were so massive I couldn't break them at all. I just shoved them out the door whole.  
And we still couldn't get that Thor slab out. 
THE LACTOSE PROJECTILE INCIDENT 
As I think back to standing there at 2 AM, I could have reacted on impulse. I could have thrown in the towel, walked away, and let frustration decide for me. However, there was a time when I reacted and learned what happens when you let impulse win. 
We'd gone to visit Papa Terry in Albuquerque when you kids were younger. He had suffered a stroke, and we spent a few days there with him. 
On the way home, in our less-than-stellar minivan that took all of my automotive skills just to keep running, we were trying to get home. The kids were screaming, and there were snacks and dirty diapers scattered about. Crumbled animal crackers in every crevice, the kind you know you can never get out. I’ll never forget that sweet and pungent odor that sticks in your nose. I believe it was Logan who threw up, and we had to pull over on the side of the I-40 freeway. 
While your mom was cleaning up one kid, I was trying to fill up a bottle with milk to feed Matix. It was one of those fancy bottles with a valve inside that let air in as the child sucked on it. However, the bottle was either out of alignment or broken, so it was leaking everywhere. There was milk all over his face, on the seat, dripping down my arms... 
Suddenly, I had had enough. I couldn't take it, and I turned around and threw it out into the high Arizona desert as far as I could. I stood there with my head held high. It felt great to fling that wretched bottle out of my life. Who designed that thing anyway? He was probably a vile, vindictive man who’d never even met a baby. 
After my brief moment of victory, standing there with my foot in the air like Captain Morgan,  I looked back at your mom. She was staring at me in disbelief, or possibly disappointment? It was hard to tell. Shaking her head, she said, "You know that's our only bottle, right?"  
 
I actually did know that. My kids would be stronger for it. They were going to hunt their own game, find their own food! At least, that's what I was thinking as I was trying to climb the barbed wire fence and dodge cactus on my way to fetch the bottle back. 
In the heat of the moment, throwing that bottle felt like taking control. But there I was, climbing through cactus and barbed wire, learning that dramatic gestures usually just create new problems. If I had reacted that way in El Paso —just walked away, given up, let frustration win— it might have felt great for a moment. But the consequences would have been far more severe than climbing a barbed wire fence. We're talking bankruptcy, a destroyed reputation, the end of everything my father built, and what your uncle and I were in the process of building.  
The Edge of Ruin
I mentioned our company's future was riding on this job, but let me spell out what that meant: If we failed, we were finished. Not just this contract—finished as a business.  
The financial math was starkly terrifying. If we walked away, we'd owe the cost of tearing out the foundation and replacing it, the cost of delaying the project, and the cost of production downtime for a factory that essentially printed money. We could easily have owed 20 times what we bid—$2.5 million or more. We'd be bankrupt. 
But worse than the money was what it would do to our name. To our credibility. Everything my dad had built over decades would be destroyed in one weekend. No contractor would hire us again. No client would trust us. The Record name would be synonymous with "the guys who couldn't handle El Paso." 
When Crazy Becomes Necessary 
On Sunday morning at around 7:00 am,  your uncle Jake and I finally dragged ourselves to the hotel. We had been awake since 4:00 on Saturday morning. Twenty-seven hours of fighting concrete, and every muscle in my body was screaming. You know that exhaustion where you're too tired to sleep? Where you lie down and your body keeps vibrating like you're still operating equipment? That was us. I remember hitting that hotel bed thinking I could sleep for two days straight. My hands were still cramped in the shape of backhoe controls. The room's AC sounded like heaven after the factory noise. 
An hour and a half later, my phone rang, Uncle Jake was on the other end… I didn't even have to answer to know what he wanted. "You ready to go back?" I wasn't, but I sure wasn't going to leave everyone else there to do it without me either. 
"Sure," I heard myself say. Not because I was ready. Not because I felt strong. But because walking away meant losing everything we had built. A factory full of workers needed their building to be functional. Because sometimes 'sure' is the only word that stands between you and complete ruin. 
 When we got back, not much had changed. That slab, the one Thor couldn’t move, was still there. Staring at us in arrogance. Your Grandpa had found a giant 48,000-pound forklift out in back of the plant - the kind they use to move shipping containers. We didn’t know whose it was, and we didn’t care. We  drove that forklift right down into the hole. The controls on the forklift were fine, but it wouldn't run unless you held the choke on. Your grandpa climbed on that thing like a cowboy mounting a bull, except this bull was made of steel and hydraulics. He was reaching into the engine and holding it manually while riding on top of  this mechanical monster. 
Holding our breath, hoping this was it, we watched as it lifted the slab into the air. I took the backhoe and slammed the bucket into the slab and creeeeaaakkk… When that 20-inch slab finally cracked—thanks to Jake's all-night sawing weakening the rebar—it sounded like thunder. Steel and concrete tearing and pulling away as it thudded onto the ground. We had to cut the lower rebar with grinders, sparks flying while Grandpa held tons of concrete from falling and crushing us. 
It was then that we realized that the forklift was trapped in the hole. Terrific. We had to get it out somehow. We had one small chain, and who knows what weight it was rated for. We just needed it to hold. I watched that chain stretch, and all I could think about was waiting for it to snap and take someone's head off. Your grandpa just stood there, as calm as a Sunday morning, working this one-in-a-million problem like he'd done it a thousand times before. 
The Comedy of Errors Continues 
After we finally conquered the Thor slab, we faced a problem nobody had anticipated. Two crews—us and the rigging company—stood on opposite sides of the hole, staring at each other like gunfighters at high noon. Instead of drawing pistols, we were both waiting for the other to make the first move with the two 30-foot, 2,000-pound rail inserts. They were the company responsible for setting up the equipment after we finished the foundation. The engineer had told both crews to "assist" with installation, so we were both waiting for the other expectantly. 
When we finally realized that neither crew was ready to install the rails into the hole, we grabbed our backhoes and placed the rails ourselves. No discussion. No blame. No "that's not our job." When you're 48 hours in and everything's on the line, you stop worrying about whose responsibility it is and start caring only about what needs to happen. The job must be done at any cost—waiting for someone else to step up is just another way of choosing to fail. 
We had not brought enough labor to complete the job, or at least not at the 24-hour pace we were running. Our guys were wearing down fast, and most of them were there just for the weekend. The trucking contractor we had hired to haul off the concrete had some "guys" he could bring in. Desperate, we said, bring them. Well, they showed up all right, in tennis shoes and baseball caps. On a job like this, hard hats, steel-toed boots, and all of the proper safety gear are a must. So, we scrambled and found some hard hats, hoping no one would say anything. 
We finished the day by installing rebar and our pre-built drains. At this point, we were just throwing the rebar in. I mean, the work was passable, but we had a crew of guys that had never even touched rebar—it was not the precision type of work we usually do. We were desperately trying to catch up on our timeline. Working late into the night, we finally were ready for our pour the next morning. 
Our Phoenix crew flew home Sunday night—they had other jobs on Monday. That left a skeleton crew for the actual concrete pour, which took place on Monday at 6 AM, and those of us who remained were running on whatever fumes we had left.  
To make matters more challenging, our original pump company had canceled on Thursday. No explanation, just a casual "can't make it." We scrambled and, fortunately, found one company willing to bring a pump at the last minute. The replacement barely fit in the building's 20-foot ceiling. When we started setting up the pump, the boom bumped into an 8-inch water main—GONG. The kind of ominous bell sound that makes everyone freeze. 
If that pipe burst, we wouldn't have a sewage problem anymore. We'd have Noah's flood. As we poured, the concrete was taking so long to pump that it was setting up in the trucks. Your grandpa instructed the drivers: "Add water." 
"How much?" 
He gave them a look that could melt steel: "All of it." Like a cornered bobcat—pure, focused intensity. Haha, I was busy running the rod, but believe me, they put every last drop of water in that truck! 
Truth in the Trenches 
While we poured, we discovered the real disaster: we'd broken through the main sewer line for the entire plant. It was Monday morning, and we had 640,000 pounds of concrete on its way, ready to fill the hole. We were pouring into what would become a cesspool as 300 employees showed up for work and turned on all the machines. 
We called an emergency plumbing company, and there they were, lying on their stomachs in a 3-foot deep trench, fixing the sewer line that ran through our foundation while we poured concrete above them. One mistake with tons of flowing concrete would have spelled catastrophic disaster.  
The factory noise was beyond deafening. Earplugs and noise-canceling headphones together weren't enough. We communicated in gestures and looks, the kind of wordless understanding that only comes from shared suffering. By hour 78, I wasn't thinking anymore. I was just moving, a concrete-pouring zombie. My hands moved, my feet moved, but my mind had checked out somewhere around hour 60. 
As we poured the concrete, each pass was getting closer to the broken pipe. The engineer came over to my dad, who was standing there with his hands on his hips, looking down at the plumbers. “Are they going to fix the pipe in time?” He looked up and into the engineer's eyes and said, “Yes.” Not because he knew it would work out, but because it had to. It must work. There were no other options at that point. We had used all of the tricks we had, all of the skills, knowledge, and energy. It was all gone at that point. All that was left was faith, and faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. Hebrews 11:1  
 
When the plumbers finally did fix the pipe and get out of the hole, we were standing three feet above them on our floating forms suspended in the air. You know that point where the receiver is catching the ball on the sideline? Toes sliding, reaching to catch the ball with his fingertips, knowing he is about to crash to the ground? That’s what it was like as we desperately waited for them to finish. With no time left on the concrete before it was completely unusable, we immediately swung the pump boom over and filled up the hole.  
That job finally ended, but only through sheer willpower. For two weeks after the fact, I had PTSD. Not the clinical kind, but I'd relive every detail over and over. Being in that extended, high-level stress for four days straight had taken a toll on me. I’d walk through the job in my head, step by step, then start at zero again. It was just an inkling of what it is like for a soldier coming home from battle, and even that was tough to get through. It was as if my mind was trying to process what we'd accomplished, but couldn’t. 
The Lesson at the Bottom of the Hole 
We barely broke even after the job was finished. Paying for the sewer repair, unexpected trucking costs, dump fees, and extra labor. The client was happy — we'd delivered the impossible. But happiness doesn't pay bills. 
Here's what that hole taught me, though. Faith and doubt are both beliefs. In that moment at 2 AM, covered in hydraulic fluid and concrete dust, while staring at a disaster that wasn't my fault but absolutely was my problem, I could have believed one of two stories: 
"This is impossible. We're in over our heads. No one could fix this." 
Or: 
"We're going to finish this. We'll figure it out. We always do." 
At that moment, both were equally true. The difference was which story I chose to tell myself. Romans 12:2 says, "Be transformed by the renewing of your mind”—that's what had to happen first. New story, new mind, new results." 
Since El Paso, we've never been caught unprepared again. Do we need one saw? We bring two. If a 20,000 lb excavator is enough, we bring a 40,000  lb excavator. We have backup plans for our backup plans. Because you don't rise to the occasion—you fall to your level of preparation. The real lesson wasn't about equipment or preparation. It was about that moment when everything goes wrong, and you have to decide who you really are. It came down to the decision that your uncle, grandpa, and I had made. We were going to finish the job. We were going to be successful.  
Your 2 AM Will Come 
I don't know when your 2 AM moment will arrive. Maybe it'll be literal—some crisis that has you up in the middle of the night. Perhaps it will be metaphorical—that moment when life strips away your energy and excuses and demands to know who you are. 
But it will come. And when it does, you'll have to decide. 
Will you be someone who finds reasons or someone who finds ways? Someone who explains why it couldn't be done or someone who figures out how to do it anyway? 
Beliefs become reality through changed behavior. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy— if you tell yourself you're a particular kind of person long enough, you will start acting like it. Then one day you wake up and realize you've become exactly what you kept telling yourself you were. 
“The story becomes the belief. The belief becomes the behavior. The behavior becomes the result." 
That night in El Paso, I told myself we were finishers. Not hopeful finishers. Not maybe-finishers. Just finishers. Period. So we finished. Not because we were special or tough or even particularly smart. But because once you decide that's who you are, your brain stops looking for exits and starts looking for solutions. I call it the Identity Loop. The story becomes the belief. The belief becomes the behavior. The behavior becomes the result.  

When I was your age, I thought successful people had something I didn't: better luck, better connections, better genetics. El Paso taught me the truth: they just told themselves better stories. 
We still talk about that job sometimes. We learned every tough lesson all at once (well, maybe not every lesson, but a lot of them!). We discussed it thoroughly because we were never going to be caught unprepared like that again. We didn’t talk about it with pride exactly, more like survivors discussing a storm they weathered together. We charged into hell for a leather ball, as they say in football. Except our ball was made of concrete, and our hell was very, very real. 
But we scored. 
Wrestling for Your Blessing  
I've thought about Jacob wrestling with that angel through the night. He wouldn't let go until he got his blessing. The thing is, Jacob walked away with a limp. The blessing came with a permanent reminder of the struggle. That's what El Paso was for me—my wrestling match. 78 hours of refusing to let go. And like Jacob, I came away transformed. Not the same person who started the job. The struggle changed my identity, just like Jacob became Israel that night. Sometimes I wonder if that's the point of our 2 AM moments. Not just to test us, but to transform us. To turn Jacobs into Israel’s. To forge new identities in the furnace of adversity. 
The Story you tell yourself  
What story are you telling yourself right now? I mean it. Put the book down for a second and think about it. Every morning, every challenge, every moment of decision—we're telling ourselves a story. Like it says in Proverbs 23:7, “As he thinks in his heart, so is he.” The story becomes the identity. The identity becomes the life. 
What's the narrative running in your head about who you are? About what you're capable of? About what's possible for someone like you? Because that story—the one you tell yourself when no one's listening, when you're alone with your thoughts at 2 AM—that's the one that matters. That's the one that determines whether you'll build something worth building or spend your life explaining why you couldn't. 
The concrete dust has long since washed off. The hydraulic fluid stains faded years ago. But the decision I made in that hole—the story I chose to believe about who we were and what we could do—that's still paying dividends. 
Your story is being written right now. In every small decision, every moment of doubt, every time you choose between the easy excuse and the hard truth. 
So I'll ask you again: What story are you telling yourself? 
And more importantly: Is it good enough for who you want to become? 
Because if it's not, you can change it. Right now. This second. 
You are what you say you are. 
The only question is: What are you going to say?

But What Happens When No One's Watching? 
I want to share something with you about telling yourself the right story. It only works if you have the character to back it up. You can say you're a finisher, a builder, a success—but what happens when life offers you a shortcut? When no one's watching? When doing the right thing cost you something real? 
In 1992, my parents faced that exact test. A bank error put $4,900 in their account—almost exactly what they owed in crushing debt. The bank manager himself said it was untraceable. Free money. A gift from the universe. The kind of mistake that could change everything. 
What would you do? 
Because character—real character—isn't built in holes at 2 AM when everyone's watching you struggle, it's built in bank lobbies at 9 AM when no one would ever know what choice you’d made. 
And that choice my parents made? It changed everything. Not in the way you'd think. 
But that's a story for Chapter 2…  
 

The Truth in 5 Minutes
The stories we tell ourselves in crisis become our reality—until we decide to tell a different one.
That night in El Paso, covered in hydraulic fluid at 2 AM, I could have believed "This is impossible" or "We're going to finish this." Both were equally true in that moment. The difference? One story would have bankrupted us. The other built us.
Most people never realize they're living out a script they wrote in their darkest moments. "I'm not good enough." "I always fail when it matters." "This is too hard for someone like me." These aren't observations—they're decisions that become destiny.
You are what you say you are—especially at 2 AM.
Your identity drives your actions, your actions create your results, and your results reinforce your identity. It's a loop that either lifts you up or drags you down. Faith and doubt are both beliefs. In any crisis, both stories seem equally valid. The one you choose doesn't just affect the outcome—it becomes who you are.
Your 5-Minute Action Plan:
	•	Name your crisis story (2 min): What do you tell yourself when things go wrong? What's the recurring narrative about your limitations?
	•	Choose your new identity (2 min): Not "I will try to..." but "I am someone who..." Make it present tense, make it definitive. "I am someone who finds solutions." "I am someone who finishes what I start."
	•	Act before you sleep (1 min): Write your new identity statement. Put it where you'll see it first thing tomorrow. Set a phone reminder to read it. Set it to the home screen on your phone.
Since El Paso, we've never been caught unprepared again. But the real lesson wasn't about equipment. It was about that moment when everything goes wrong, and you have to decide who you really are.
The Builder's Formula at Work: IDENTITY This chapter showed you the first tool—Identity. When I declared "We are finishers" in that hole, I was using the most powerful tool any builder has.
Before You Move On: Tonight, write down your new identity statement. Not tomorrow—tonight. Because tomorrow's 2 AM moment is coming, and you need to be ready with a better story.


Chapter 2:  
Character Is Who You Are When No One Is Watching 
 
Uncompromising integrity is my standard. My character and honor will be steadfast. My word is my bond.  
—From The Builder's Creed 
Mom's hands were shaking as she stared at the bank statement. Not from fear. But from possibility. 
There sat $4,900 in her account. The deposit slip in her hands said $490. She checked it three times, her calculator clicking like a time bomb. The ATM had added an extra zero. Just like that. Mathematical magic that could change everything. 
"It's real," she said to herself, then louder to the empty kitchen. "The money's really there." 
In 1992, that error — that gift from God seemingly placed right in my parents' laps — would have wiped out almost their entire debt in one stroke. It was freedom served on a bank statement. 
The next morning, she drove to Valley National Bank and gave it all back. Every. Single. Penny. 
The Debt That Defined Us 
I was about twelve; old enough to understand that $4,900 was more money than I'd ever seen, but too young to grasp why she'd return it when the bank manager himself would say it was "completely untraceable." 
But first, let me paint you the real picture. We'd left Arlington Arizona a few years earlier with $15,000 in debt hanging over us like a storm cloud. We’d failed at the experiment of living on 10 acres out in the country— it turned out dreams don't pay bills, and paradise is too far from work when gas costs money you don't have. 
Since then, my parents had been chipping away at that mountain one pebble at a time. Fifteen thousand down to ten. Ten down to eight. By 1992, they'd whittled the debt to about $5,000 through the kind of grinding consistency that breaks most people. One concrete patio at a time. One driveway at a time. Four hundred and ninety dollars here, six hundred there.  
Dad would come home from work with a trailer full of dirt—and by trailer, I mean an old Dodge pickup bed with a hitch welded onto the front. Pure Arizona redneck engineering. He'd worn multiple pickaxes down to nubs over the years. That's not an exaggeration. We’re talking metal tools ground to nothing by pure will and desert hardpan. My brother and I's job was to shovel all of that dirt out of the trailer so it would be ready for the next day. Every time he brought it home full, no exceptions. While other kids watched cartoons, we moved earth. 
When Heaven Tests Your Character
That particular job—a small patio for an elderly couple—netted $490. Enough for groceries and supplies for a month if Mom worked her magic. Dad drove to Valley National Bank in Sun City West Arizona after work, still dusty from the pour, and fed his deposit slip into their brand new ATM machine. State of the art for 1992, which meant it only ate your card half the time. 
My mom had this ritual every month. The kitchen table would be cleared and the bank statement spread out like a war map, the calculator ready for action. She'd reconcile every cent, because when you're that close to the edge, every cent is a soldier in your army. 
That's when she found it. The deposit showed $4,900, not $490. The kitchen suddenly felt smaller, like the walls were listening." She checked the automated line (press 1 for English, press 2 for false hope). The balance was real. The money was there. Sitting in their account like it belonged. 
Five thousand in debt. $4,900 in unexpected money. She did the math. Her face scrunched up as she realized what this meant. No more payment plans. No more stretching pennies. No more choosing between gas and groceries. Freedom from the weight that had been crushing them since Arlington. 
 It was the same freedom I'd feel years later on September 1st, waking up in a rental after losing our house, finally understanding that sometimes you have to lose everything to find out what really matters. But that's a story for another chapter. 
On that day though, what was on my Mom's face wasn't joy. It was conflict. The next morning, Mom drove to the bank alone. Dad had already left for a job site—concrete waits for no one, especially when you're trying to outrun debt. 
She asked to see the manager. He was the kind of guy who wore his authority like an expensive suit, which probably cost more than our monthly food budget. Gray at the temples, soft at the middle, the look of a man who'd never dug a hole in his life. When she explained the error, his entire demeanor shifted. Not to gratitude—to condescension. 
"Mrs. Record," he said, looking down his nose at her like she was a child who didn't understand how banks worked, "this error is completely untraceable. Our ATM systems don't keep those kinds of records. As far as we're concerned, that money is yours." 
“It doesn't belong to us.” 
He tried to convince her to keep it. He laid out all the reasons why returning it would be foolish: The bank would never know. It wouldn't hurt anyone—banks have insurance for these things. Think of what that money could do for your family. 
Mom sat there, purse in her lap, wearing her best dress—the one she saved for church and important meetings. The car outside had needed four tries to start that morning, each turn of the key a prayer. This money could fix that. Could fix everything. 
"It doesn't belong to us," she stated.  
Simple as that. It was as if there was no other option; keeping money that wasn't yours seemed as impossible as flying. 
The Return 
When Mom got home from the bank, Dad was unloading from the day—a ritual as predictable as sunset. His hands were the kind of callused that can only come from wearing out steel while working in the sun. Concrete dust and sweat combined and dried into the creases of his pants. White salt formed around the edges. Truly a hard-working man if there ever was one. 
She told him all about the bank, the manager, the whole ordeal. He dried his hands on his jeans—the same jeans with concrete splatter and sweat stains—looked at her, and said the only thing that mattered:  "We do what's right." 
Not "Let's think about it." Not "Maybe we could use it and pay it back later." Just "We do what's right." Like gravity. Like breathing. Like there was no other option in the universe. 
They made the bank take back every penny. They had to insist firmly. The manager drew up the paperwork as if he were authorizing a refund for stupidity. The teller who processed it kept looking between them and the withdrawal slip like they were speaking Martian. 
"You sure about this?" the teller asked three times. Yes. Yes. Yes. 
The Original No One's Watching Test 
 This story reminds me of my favorite character study in the Bible.  Joseph was a slave in Potiphar's house. He had been given complete control over everyone and everything that happened in his household. Day after day, Potiphar’s wife tried to seduce Joseph. No one would know. Potiphar was away at work.  
The other servants wouldn't tell. But Joseph ran. Left his cloak in her hands and ran out of the house. Not because anyone was watching, but because of who he was when no one was watching. It cost him everything in the moment—falsely accused, thrown in prison.  
But that character, that integrity, when it would have been so easy to compromise? That's what prepared him to run all of Egypt eventually. Character compounds, even through prison cells. 
My parents left that bank $4,900 poorer and infinitely richer. What happened next is where character pays dividends you can’t calculate. But first, let me tell you about my character being tested. 
When Friends Test Your Character 
Fast forward twenty years. Character tests don't stop coming just because you're older. 
Our pastor, whom I love dearly despite his tendency to “voluntell” people into situations, was on stage talking about the Super Bowl coming to Arizona. Without warning—and definitely without asking first—he announced: "And Israel will be hosting a Super Bowl party at his house!" 
I barely knew Israel then. We'd progressed from me butchering his name to casual hellos. But I saw the panic flash across his face. His house sits on several acres that constantly require work. That was the "my yard looks like a jungle and now 50 people are coming over" look. 
So I did what felt right: showed up at his house with a truck full of tools. For a couple of hours in the Arizona heat, I attacked his property with a weed eater like I was preparing for a presidential visit. When I knocked on the door to let his wife know I had finished, she answered with the grateful smile of someone watching a stranger save their weekend. 
"Please, come in for some water," she offered. 
Now, it's February in Arizona. No shade, no clouds, it feels like 115 degrees outside. I am drenched in sweat, and this lovely woman is inviting me into her dark, cool house while her husband isn't home. 
"No thank you," I said, probably too quickly, with a look that was apparently misinterpreted. Years later, she told me her impression of the exchange: "You looked at me like I was trying to seduce you! Like I was some desperate housewife!" Let me be clear—this woman's character is beyond reproach. She was simply being kind, grateful for the help, and could see I was overheated.  
The reality? I was just trying to be appropriate. Character sometimes means turning down water in the desert because it's the right thing to do. Even if you look like an idiot doing it. Israel and his wife are family to us now. And it started with showing up when I didn't have to, and saying no when it would have been easier to say yes. 
Back in Arlington, my parents had gotten saved and committed to following God and doing things right. That decision led them through years of debt reduction, through sacrifice and hard work, all the way to the test at the bank—a kind of final exam on whether they meant what they said about integrity. 
Very soon after they returned the money, a manager at a mobile home park where my Dad had been pouring concrete made them an offer: move into his park, and he'd pay $1,000 to cover moving costs—enough to haul our mobile home out of that Arlington property. Plus, Dad would get the contract to pour all of the concrete around their new home on the new lot. 
We pulled our mobile home out of that dusty hole in Arlington—my Dad pushed all the old patios into the hole where the house was and tied the awnings down on top like he was burying the past. That night, we were sleeping in the new park. New start, new opportunities, and my Dad getting paid to improve his own home. 
"Character compounds faster than money ever will." 
Within the year, my parents were debt-free. It wasn’t because of a banking error, but because of banking on character. A year later, after they finally paid off that debt through honest work, we moved to Waddell. Then later into a nice neighborhood. Not because of a windfall or a lottery ticket, but because character compounds faster than money ever will. 
The Compound Interest of Character 
You see, word gets around in construction faster than concrete sets in a Phoenix summer. People hear about the contractor who shows up. Who bills honestly. Who fixes mistakes without being asked. Who returns $4,900 because it's not his to keep.  
Dad's phone started ringing more. Like Proverbs says, “A good name is more desirable than great riches; to be esteemed is better than silver or gold.” 22:1 Word travels fast in construction. Character travels faster. He began to get better jobs. Bigger jobs. Jobs where the client paid on time because they trusted him completely. One small patio at a time became one account at a time. 
That bank error was a test, but not the kind you think. It wasn't about testing whether my parents were honest — that was already decided back in Arlington when they chose to follow God and do what was right. The test was to see if they understood that some things are worth more than money. 
What I saw that day was that when you guard your integrity like it's your most valuable asset —because it is—God will reward that choice. The reward isn’t always immediate or obvious, but it does always come. 
Like compound interest, but for your soul. 
Your Character Is Already Being Written 
Character isn't built in the big moments. It's built in the thousand tiny choices that no one sees. 
	•	Returning the extra change at the drive-through 
	•	Telling the cashier they forgot to ring up an item 
	•	Admitting you were wrong when you could have gotten away with it 
	•	Keeping your word when it costs you something 
Your name is your legacy—protect it. And your name isn't what's on your business card. It's what people say about you when you're not in the room. It's what your kids will tell their kids about who you were. 
 “Character isn't built in the big moments. It's built in the thousand tiny choices that no one sees.” 
My parents could have kept that money. No one would have known except them. And me. And my brother. And eventually you. And your kids. And their kids. That's the thing about character—it echoes through generations. 
The Test You won't See Coming 
Your $4,900 moment is coming. Maybe it already has. It won't look exactly like my parents' test. It might be: 
	•	A client who overpays and doesn't notice 
	•	Credit for work you didn't do 
	•	An opportunity to blame someone else for your mistake 
	•	Information you could use to your advantage 
	•	A shortcut that no one would ever discover 
The amount doesn't matter. The situation doesn't matter. What matters is what you do when you're holding something that isn't yours—whether it's money, credit, or blame. 
So I'll ask you what that bank manager never understood: What's your integrity worth? Not in some philosophical sense. In real dollars and cents. What would it take for you to sell your character? $4,900? $10,000? $100,000? $4900 is a lot more in today's dollars, but the principle remains the same. Whatever price you put on your integrity, life will eventually offer you precisely that amount. And when it does, you'll find out who you really are. 
“Whatever price you put on your integrity, life will eventually offer you exactly that amount.” 
What I've learned is that trust is earned, not given. But you earn it from yourself first. Every time you do the right thing when no one's watching, you deposit trust in your character bank. And that account pays dividends forever. 
The bill for character always comes due. You either pay it upfront with integrity, or you pay it forever with regret. 
My parents paid upfront. In full. With exact change. 
What about you? 
When your moment comes—when the bank makes an error in your favor, when no one would know, when keeping it would solve real problems—what will you do? 
Because character is who you are when no one is watching. Except someone is always watching.  You are.

Character Without Action Is Just Good Intentions 
So You Have Character—But Can You Start Something?  Here's what watching my parents return that $4,900 taught me: having character is essential, but it's not enough. You can be the most honest person in the world, sitting on your couch, accomplishing nothing. 
My parents had integrity, but they also had something else —they took action. They didn't just think about doing the right thing. They got up, drove to the bank, and completed the transaction. They started a business, poured concrete, and moved homes in a single day when opportunity knocked. 
Which brings us to a realization that changed everything for me: Many good people die with their integrity intact and their dreams untouched. They're good people who never start. Honest folks who never move. They have character but no momentum. 
You know the type. The people who will return the extra change at the drive-through but won't start the business they've been planning for ten years. They'll tell the truth even when it hurts, but won't tell themselves what’s true about why they're still stuck. They have all the character in the world but none of the courage to use it for something bigger than being "good." 
So what's stopping them? What's stopping you? 
It's simpler than you think. And that simplicity is what makes it hard to swallow - because if it's that simple, what's your excuse? Because while character determines who you are, action determines who you become. And the gap between those two? That's where most dreams go to die. 
But it doesn't have to be that way. Not if you understand what I learned the hard way about starting... Which brings me to Disney, a magnetic toy, and the most expensive hesitation of my life, but that's a story for Chapter 3... 
The Truth in 5 Minutes
Character isn't built when everyone's watching—it's built in the thousand tiny choices no one sees.
My parents stood in that bank with $4,900 that wasn't theirs—exactly what they owed in crushing debt. The manager said it was untraceable. They could have kept it. No one would have known except them. And me. And my brother. And eventually you. And your kids.
That's the thing about character—it echoes through generations. Not through what you say, but through what you do when no one's keeping score.
Here's the truth that changes everything: Whatever price you put on your integrity, life will eventually offer you exactly that amount.
And when it does—when that ATM error or overpayment or perfect excuse appears—you'll find out who you really are. Not who you want to be. Who you are. Every choice is either a deposit or withdrawal from your trust account. Unlike a bank account, once you're overdrawn on self-trust, the interest rate on getting it back is brutal.
Your 5-Minute Action Plan:
	•	Name your last compromise (2 min): When did you last take the easy way when you knew the right way? What did you tell yourself to justify it?
	•	Find your price (2 min): Be honest—what amount would tempt you? $500? $5,000? $50,000? What does that number tell you about yourself?
	•	Act before you sleep (1 min): What integrity decision is waiting for you right now? An email to send? A mistake to own? Money to return? Write down exactly what you'll do.
My parents left that bank $4,900 poorer and infinitely richer. Within a year, they were debt-free. Not because of a windfall, but because character compounds faster than money ever will.
The Builder's Formula at Work: IDENTITY + PERSISTENCE My parents showed both Identity (we are people of integrity) and Persistence (paying back debt honestly over time). Character compounds when identity and persistence align.
Before You Move On: Tonight, handle that thing you've been avoiding. The conversation, the confession, the correction—whatever it is. Do it before you sleep. Not because anyone's watching, but because you are.










Chapter 3: 
Starting Before You're Ready 
 
I expect to lead and be led. In the absence of orders, I will take charge, lead my team, and accomplish the mission. I will lead by example in all situations. 
—From The Builder's Creed 
The Disney employee was selling my invention to thousands of families a day. My exact idea. My exact design. My innovation. But someone else's millions. And it was all because I listened to the wrong expert instead of starting when my gut said ‘GO!’. 
But before I tell you how that happened, I need you to understand something about who I am. 
The Pattern of Starting 
By my count, I've started at least nine real businesses. Not ideas. Not plans. Actual businesses where money changed hands and value was created. 
When I was young, I mowed yards and walked dogs. Nothing fancy, but I was learning that work equals money. At 16, with your grandpa's help, I started KR Concrete. I was writing professional proposals on carbon copy paper while other contractors were scrawling quotes on napkins. 
After I concluded that college wasn't for me —despite a full-ride academic scholarship a dedicated chemistry teacher helped me get— I went to work with your Grandpa. My internship after freshman year had shown me a future I didn't want: unhappy people, divorces everywhere, and workers struggling to make ends meet. So I chose to build something of my own instead. 
Around 2007, your mom and I started Bubby Boutique, a kids' clothing drop shipping company named after Mason's nickname. I traded landscape work for a website (the programmer ended up ripping me off —whole other story). When the 2008 recession hit, the company faded away. Another lesson learned. 
After years of grinding through the recession, Dad offered me and Uncle Jake a partnership in Record Construction. Five percent per year for five years would make us  25% owners. At year five, over dinner, he surprised us—33% each. We were truly in. 
Then came Record Homes. One day, it hit me: instead of pouring concrete around mobile homes, why aren't we placing the homes ourselves? We discussed it in our small home office, which was in my brother's and my old bedroom, and decided that we wanted to pursue it.  After a particularly profitable concrete job, we got our manufactured home license and bought our first home. But it wasn’t as easy as that.  
Getting into an industry like this wasn’t easy. “They” don’t just let you in. We had the necessary licenses, insurance, and paperwork. We were ready. Our first stop was the manufacturing plant. The salesman took us for a ride on the golf cart to tour the plant. We thought we were being clear, but he was putting in the effort of a person who had done it countless times before and wasn’t hearing us. Suddenly, he stopped—tires screeching on the slick concrete—he turned around to see us and said, “Wait, why are you here?” He said it with a slightly panicked, puzzled look on his face. “We are here to buy homes,” we said innocently. He thought we were just customers who bought a home and wanted a tour. We were customers, but we wanted to purchase multiple homes, not just one.  
We finished the tour, but then things somehow became tense and awkward. As we left, he said he would get back to us. Then, that was it. Crickets. No one would answer our call, the receptionist would take a message, but we wouldn’t get called back. It was a dead end. We thought maybe we would just have to go back to being concrete guys. That is, until my Dad was sitting in a man’s office named Sonny. This man had been in the industry since before my Dad’s time. A kind, thoughtful man with creases at the corner of his eyes that come from a life of squinting into the sun with a smile on his face. He knew everyone in the industry. His comment? “Hmm, interesting.” You want to know what happened 2 hours later? The phone rang. On the other end was the salesman, “Hi, we would love to sell you homes.”  
Now I can’t tell you how that happened. We asked Sonny about it, but he was adamant that he had nothing to do with it. Somehow, though, I feel like I could see a light in his eyes. The kind of light that comes from the joy of helping others. 
Year one profit: $8,000. Not exactly killing it. Year two: $12,000. Still grinding. We weren't even sure if this would work. Each new lesson we learned was tough but necessary. Home set company not coming through? We obtained our installer's license and are now able to set up our own homes. Septic tank contractors not showing up? We do our own now. Today? You kids help install them. Fourth generation in the making." 
We tried billboards with Record Outdoor. What a brutal industry to crack. Just like manufactured homes, “they” don’t just let you in. We don't have a billboard empire, but we do have our sign along I-10. It’s not giant, but it has our name on it. Sometimes that's enough. 
 
I founded ExcavatorFoot.com after developing a revolutionary attachment that enables excavators to lift and pivot without needing to move. Built it from scrap steel and a forklift hydraulic cylinder, and it’s currently patent pending. I’m talking to manufacturers: another start, another shot at changing an industry. 
Recently, we started our Playa Bowls franchise with ten locations planned for the West Valley. Acai bowls are the healthier food trend we saw coming. Every one of you kids and your cousins will have a shot at ownership if you want it. 
VoiceQuote came from 30 years of construction pain. While software guys were learning to code, I was watching the sun rise while setting forms. That real-world pain became our unique advantage. 
And I'm building this personal brand, writing this book. Because in a world where AI can fake anything, the only differentiator left is the authentic story of who you really are and what you've really done. 
Starting Despite Opposition 
You know who understood starting despite opposition? Nehemiah. This guy is comfortable as the king's cupbearer, but he can't stop thinking about Jerusalem's broken walls. So, what does he do? He doesn't form a committee. Doesn't wait for perfect conditions. He goes to the king, gets permission, and starts. 
His enemies mocked him the entire time: "What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they restore it for themselves? Will they offer sacrifices? Will they finish in a day?" But Nehemiah kept building. Sword in one hand, trowel in the other. Truly a warrior and a builder. The wall that experts said would take years? Finished in 52 days. Not because conditions were perfect. Because someone finally started. 
That's what separates builders from dreamers. Dreamers wait for ideal circumstances. Builders start with what they have. 
What Starting Teaches You 
You either get a blessing or a lesson. Both move you forward. 
Bubby Boutique? Blessing: learned e-commerce early. Lesson: timing matters, and the economy doesn't care about your plans. But we started, we tried, we learned. Total cost of education? Maybe $5,000. Total value of education? Priceless. 
Record Homes started with a pretty low $8,000 profit, which we split three ways after a full year of work. Most people would quit. We saw it differently —we'd learned the business. We kept building, kept pushing. Now we control the whole process from land to installation. Those margins look different when you own every step. 
The billboard dream? Mostly a lesson. But here's the thing about lessons —they're only expensive if you don't learn from them. Some industries have gates, and some gates aren't worth storming. But you don't know until you try. 
You know what's funny? After every wave passes —whether it be billboards, mini storage, mobile home parks— suddenly, YouTube is full of gurus selling courses on how they got rich doing precisely that. The only problem? They were there early, and now it's too late. They're selling shovels after the gold rush ended. 
Which is why I no longer wait for permission or perfect timing. I start when I see the opportunity, not when someone creates a course about it. 
I've looked at every opportunity through this lens for years now—"selling the sellers." Look for people who are selling the actual service, then find out what they need—the more painful the problem, the greater the opportunity. Instead of being another contractor fighting for jobs, I asked: What tool do contractors desperately need? That's how VoiceQuote was born—solving the painful problem of spending hours on quotes that should take minutes. 
The pattern is everywhere once you see it. Instagram doesn't create content—they built the platform for creators. Shopify doesn't sell products—they sell the ability to sell products. The most significant opportunities aren't in doing the thing—they're in enabling others to do the thing. 
That consultant who told me Tag-Alongs wouldn't work? He was selling his expertise to inventors. He understood the model perfectly—he just directed me away from my best opportunity while he collected his fee. 
The Tag-Along Mistake 
Let me tell you about the most expensive lesson in my career. Inspired by watching you kids drag stuffed animals everywhere, I invented Tag-Alongs—magnetic attachments so toys could ride hands-free on backpacks. Every parent who saw our prototype wanted one. I spent months perfecting it. Hot glue surgeries on innocent stuffed animals. Multiple iterations of magnetic strength. The perfect angle for optimal cuteness. 
I hired a licensing company for three of my ideas: Tag-Alongs, Go-Stroller—a single-wheeled stroller —and a pepper grinder concept that turned an electric pepper grinder into a football or your favorite bobble head. The consultant took one look at Tag-Alongs and said, "That’s not worth pursuing. Focus on the other two." 
So I did. I spent months perfecting the stroller design and working on the pepper grinder mechanism. I created sell sheets and videos. Following the expert's advice, while that voice in my gut kept saying "but the Tag-Alongs..." 
Then one day, your mom texts me from Disneyland. There's a photo attached: Groot magnetically attached to some kid's backpack. My exact concept. My exact mechanism. Someone else's millions. 
Do you know what the difference was between me and the person who actually brought Tag-Alongs to market? They didn't listen to an expert who was either wrong or had ulterior motives. They listened to their gut. They saw parents wanting it and said, "That's all the validation I need." 
The pepper grinder? It never launched. Too complex, too niche. The single-wheeled stroller? I talked to every manufacturer in the US; no interest. But VoiceQuote? Built and launched in months. Why? This time, I listened to the actual users telling me what they needed, not some consultant telling me what wouldn't work. 
The token paradox 
Maybe telling you about some tokens that I still have will help it make sense. As a kid, Peter Piper Pizza was the one place we'd go as a family. The arcade was my favorite part. My dad would give us a few dollars for tokens, and I'd walk around analyzing which game would bring the most enjoyment. But I had this problem—I didn't want to run out of tokens. What if around the corner, there was a new game I'd never seen? What if I'd already blown all my tokens and couldn't experience the wonders of its digital screen? 
Well, I still have some of those tokens today. (no joke) That conservative tendency to hold onto the last of something never left me. Your mom calls me out on it all the time. When she sees me holding back, she'll say, "Go spend your tokens, Kable." It's become our saying—a gentle reminder that sometimes you need to use what you've got instead of saving it for some perfect moment that may never come. 
The Professional Who Just Showed Up 
When I was 16, I started doing concrete side jobs. These would be after my day working for grandpa. Your grandpa helped me build a proper trailer. Now, let me be clear about what I mean when I say proper trailer. It was a tiny four-foot by eight-foot homemade trailer. When I see someone like that on the road now, I get around them as quickly as possible. If they were anything like I was, the chance of catastrophic failure was imminent. Still though, it had tool boxes and a rack for forms. He took me to the swap meet and helped me gather up the necessary tools. It was something I could use to make real money. I also had a proposal book with carbon copies.—customer name, scope, materials, timeline, price, and a stainless clipbook to put it all in. I'd hand over a copy and with it one of my business cards: "KR Concrete." 
Here’s what I’ve spent a lot of time pondering and never understood-and I’ve spent a lot of time considering it. Other contractors would show up and hand over quotes scrawled on ripped-off scrap paper. Or worse—they wouldn't show up at all. Why wouldn’t they put the small amount of effort into something that paid such outsized returns?  A proposal book cost less than five dollars, yet they wouldn’t invest in it. I won more jobs from just appearing or calling back than from being good, though I was pretty good, too. But mainly, I showed up and followed through.  
There was this one job in Sun City—pre-GPS era, so we're talking actual paper maps. The roads there were circular, designed by someone who apparently hated visitors. I drove in circles for 30 minutes, getting dizzier and more lost with each loop. Finally, I found the house. The customer took one look at my sweaty, frustrated face and said, "If you can't find a house, how can you pour concrete?" To this day, it is the only job I ever lost for being late, and he was right, I deserved to lose it.  
After that, quarters for pay phones and paper maps were permanently stored in the truck. Preparation turns pressure into performance. When you're prepared, a crisis becomes manageable. Instead of panicking when something goes wrong, you perform because you have what you need. But more importantly, showing up is 90% of success. 
By the time I was making $600 in a weekend—serious money for a 16-year-old at the time—I realized something: My competition wasn't better than me. They were usually older, more experienced, and had better equipment. But most of them had one fatal flaw. They didn't follow through. 
They would say they would call back—and never did. They'd promise to show up on Tuesday and come on Thursday. They'd start a job strong—then disappear for a "quick supply run" that took three days. They’d say they would look at the job–and never show up. 
Every promise was just words. No follow-through. No reliability. No keeping their word. The customer would be standing there with money, trust, and a problem to solve. And these guys would break that trust one broken promise at a time. 
Do you know what customers really bought from the sixteen-year-old with the carbon copy receipts? Certainty. They knew I'd start as surely as they knew I'd finish. When I said Tuesday, I meant Tuesday. When I said I'd call, the phone rang. Everything else was details. 
From LEGOs to Launch 
My neighbor spent ten years drawing the perfect shed. He thought of everything. Beautiful blueprints. Multiple revisions. Color-coded organizational systems planned out. You know what he never built? A shed. 
Remember my Tag-Along disaster? Unlike my neighbor, who had blueprints for his shed, I built it. I had working prototypes ready to go. But I still failed because I let someone else's opinion override my gut instinct. For eighteen months, I perfected the wrong products while the right one collected dust. 
So when I invented the excavator foot later, I didn't make the same mistake. No CAD drawings first. No engineering calculations. No asking consultants for permission. I started with LEGOs on my kitchen table. Then scrap wood. Then actual steel. By the time I drew anything, I'd already built three versions. 
Tag-Alongs was my MBA in what not to do. The excavator foot was me applying the lesson: Build first. Fix later. Ship ugly. Iterate fast. Rich people don't get it right the first time. They just get it out the first time, then fix it fifty times while you're still working on version 1.0. They iterate faster than most people plan. 
I learned that lesson for $5,000 and eighteen months of my life. Worth every penny and every day, because I've never made that mistake again. 
Teaching the Next Generation 
You kids watch me start things constantly. New business ideas. New building projects. New systems that might work or might spectacularly fail. You see me tear apart what doesn't work and rebuild. You see me get excited about version 2.0 before version 1.0 is even cold. 
Some people might think this is scattered. Unfocused. Heck, sometimes I think it's scattered! But I only spend the minimum time needed to extract the lesson before moving to the next version. Why waste weeks perfecting something when you've already learned what you needed? I've bought 8-week coaching programs and finished them in 5 days because once I got the core insight, staying longer was just theater. 
I'm teaching you something crucial: Starting isn't precious. It's practice. Every day, the only goal is movement forward. Not perfection. Not massive leaps. Just movement. 
I watch you kids get frustrated when things don't go perfectly. What you need to understand is that people—maybe even you someday—take one step forward and two steps backward. Not because they're failing, but because that's how life works. I've watched you fall while learning to walk and fall while learning to ride bikes.  
Business is the same, but not all hits are equal. Divorce papers. Car crashes. Failed startups. Business partners who steal. Markets that crash. Some of these you can see coming and avoid. Others blindside you no matter how careful you are. 
The real wisdom lies in avoiding every hit you can and picking better partners—in business and life. Do your due diligence. Don't get divorced—work on your marriage before it breaks. Be vigilant. Because while some setbacks teach valuable lessons, others just hurt. Why learn from a bad business partner when you could have investigated their reputation first? Why recover from divorce when you could invest in your marriage daily? 
Life doesn't care about your timeline either way. The difference is whether you stay down or keep moving. The person who avoids preventable disasters AND keeps stepping after the unavoidable ones—that's who ends up miles ahead. Not the person waiting for life to stop throwing punches, and definitely not the person who walks into punches they could have dodged. 
For Builders, the Journey Never Ends 
You know what separates builders from everyone else? We're the only ones who genuinely enjoy the building more than having. Most people can't wait to reach the destination. Builders? We're already planning the next journey before we've arrived. 
I thought everyone felt this way. This assumption nearly ruined my best friend's daughter's birthday party. 
He had bought her one of those massive princess castles—the kind with "easy assembly" that lies to you right on the box. When I arrived, I saw opportunity: a puzzle to solve, a challenge to conquer. "Let's figure it out without the directions," I suggested, already pulling pieces from the box. "It'll be fun!" 
Hours later, surrounded by a sea of tiny plastic pieces—probably 1,000 of them still in their injection-molded sheets—I looked up from my focused work to catch my friend's expression. The stress in his eyes hit me like a sledgehammer. His daughter's party was starting in an hour, guests arriving soon, and we were only three-quarters done. Worse, we'd assembled several sections backwards. 
"We need to start over," I finally admitted, watching his face go from stressed to defeated. That's when it clicked: I was the only one enjoying this. For me, the hours of problem-solving had been the entertainment. The mental challenge of figuring out how Tab A connected to Slot B without instructions—that was my fun. But my friend? He just wanted his daughter to have a castle for her party. 
This experience explained everything about how I'm wired. Since childhood, I've never enjoyed playing with completed LEGO sets. Build it once with instructions, sure. But then? Take it apart immediately and build something else. The castle wasn't the point—building it was. It's why I can't sit still after finishing a project, why success feels empty until I find the next challenge. Why I rebuild systems that already work perfectly fine. My wife watches me with amusement: “Don't you ever just want to sit and enjoy what you've built?” She knows the answer—She’s seen me building trails along the river on vacation. But the building IS the enjoyment. The having is just the pause before the next building. 
That day at the birthday party, watching my friend's relief when we finally got the castle standing, I realized that not everyone finds joy in the struggle. Some people actually want to reach the destination and stay there. Some people open presents to play with them, not to figure out how they work and then build something better. Wild concept, but I'm learning to respect it. When I work with others now, I remember that moment—the stress in his eyes, the realization that I'd turned his daughter's gift into my personal puzzle. Sometimes the journey matters most. Sometimes you just need the damn castle built. 
The reason most people never start is that they're focused on the destination. They want the successful business, not the building of it. They want the finished product, not the figuring-it-out phase. They're castle-havers, not castle-builders. Life doesn't care about your timeline either way. Whether you're a journey person or a destination person, the punches keep coming. The difference is whether you stay down or keep moving. The person who avoids preventable disasters AND keeps stepping after the unavoidable ones—that's who ends up miles ahead. Not the person waiting for the perfect castle, and definitely not the person who walks into problems they could have avoided with better instructions. 
So when you're deciding whether to start something, ask yourself: Am I excited about having it, or building it? Because if you're only enthusiastic about having it, you'll quit the moment the journey gets hard. But if you're like me—if the building IS the joy—then every setback is just another puzzle to solve, every failure just another chance to take it apart and build something better. 
Why Perfect Is the Enemy of Done 
Starting can be scary. The kind of scary where you can’t decide if  you’re excited or nervous or both. Starting a business. Starting a family. Starting a conversation with someone who intimidates you. Starting a project that might fail. Starting over when you've already failed. 
That feeling never goes away. You just get faster at starting despite it, and you start realizing that it doesn’t control you.  Look, after everything I've moved forward with, whether it’s starting a business or a family, here's what I know: You can't aim at a target that doesn't exist yet. Every time I started something—from KR Concrete to VoiceQuote—the vision got clearer AFTER I began, not before. Purpose sounds nice in business books, but without an actual start date? You're just another guy with a "someday" dream. I've met plenty of them. They're still planning. 
Your Move 
So here's your assignment. Not tomorrow. Not when you feel ready. Right now, as soon as you finish this chapter. 
Start something. Anything. But here are the rules: 
	•	It has to be something you can physically begin today 
	•	It has to be small enough to finish this week 
	•	It has to be something you might fail at 
	•	You have to tell someone you're starting it 
Not planning to start. Not thinking about starting. Starting. 
Look, I know you're sitting there thinking of all the reasons why you should wait. You need more information. Tomorrow would be better. You should finish reading this book first. That's the voice that killed my Tag-Alongs. That's the voice that keeps your neighbor's shed in blueprint form. That's the voice that keeps most people exactly where they are. 
Tell that voice, “thanks for sharing”, then start anyway.

You Can Start Fast—But Can You Scale Without Burning Down? 
Here's what starting all those businesses taught me that I didn't understand until later: Starting is essential, but starting without systems is chaos. You can begin a thousand projects, but without a way to manage them, you're just creating sophisticated messes. 
We started El Paso with all the enthusiasm in the world, yet we had none of the systems we needed. We finished —barely— but at what cost? 
What if I told you there's a way to start fast AND finish strong? What if the secret isn't choosing between perfectionism and chaos, but building something in between? 
That's what systems do. They let you start fearlessly because you know you have a net. They turn "we'll figure it out as we go" from a prayer into a strategy. 
The thing is, I thought I understood systems. Growing up, I watched my Dad time every green light, know every shortcut, optimize every route. But El Paso taught me there's a difference between being efficient and being prepared for when efficiency isn't enough. 
Want to know what changed everything? What turned chaos into clockwork? What made starting fearlessly possible? Then let's talk about building your backup's backup... 

The Truth in 5 Minutes
The difference between dreamers and builders? Builders start before they're ready.
I spent eighteen months perfecting the wrong products while Tag-Alongs—my exact invention—made someone else millions at Disney. Why? Because I listened to a consultant who said it wouldn't work instead of parents who wanted to buy it. That hesitation cost me everything.
Meanwhile, I've started nine real businesses. Not ideas. Not plans. Actual businesses where money changed hands. Most taught expensive lessons. But every single one moved me forward in ways perfect planning never could.
Here's the truth that changes everything: Version 1.0 is supposed to suck.
Your job isn't to launch perfectly; it's to launch quickly and fix constantly. The start is what stops most people. Not the middle, not the end—the beginning. They die with perfect plans and zero results. You either get a blessing or a lesson. Both move you forward. But you get neither if you never start.
Your 5-Minute Action Plan:
	•	Name your Tag-Along (2 min): What's the thing you've been perfecting instead of launching? How long have you been "almost ready"? What would launching badly today look like?
	•	Identify your real blocker (2 min): Is it truly about resources, or is it fear? What's the worst realistic outcome? What's the cost of waiting another year?
	•	Act before you sleep (1 min): Choose one ugly first step. Not the perfect step—the possible step. Something you can do in the next 24 hours. Write the exact action and set a phone reminder.
When I invented the excavator foot later, I didn't repeat the Tag-Along mistake. I built it with LEGOs first. Then scrap wood. Then steel. By the time I drew anything, I'd already built three versions. Rich people don't get it right the first time. They just get it out the first time.
The Builder's Formula at Work: ACTION This entire chapter is about the second element—Action. Starting beats planning. Building beats perfecting. Every story here proves that builders build, even when it's messy.
Before You Move On: Take your ugly first step within 24 hours. Send that email. Make that prototype. Post that content. Not tomorrow—set that phone reminder right now. Because Chapter 4's systems only work if you have something to systematize.








Chapter 4:  
Systems That Set You Free 
 
I demand discipline and innovation from myself. Mission success depends upon me. I will constantly sharpen my skills, my proficiency, and my attention to detail. My training is never complete."  
—From The Builder's Creed 
After El Paso, I made a promise: Never again. 
Not "never again will equipment fail." That's physics and out of my control. Not "never again will we hit unexpected problems." That's a regular part of life and also out of my control. But never again would we be caught without a backup plan.  We have a backup plan for our backup plan now. 
The thing about promises made at 2 AM while covered in hydraulic fluid is that they sound noble in the moment. Then Monday comes around, and you've got bills to pay, crews to manage, and that same voice that says "it probably won't happen again." Systems don’t get built in boardrooms. Systems are built in the rubble of your most significant disasters.  
The Birth of the Backup for the Backup 
First thing we did after El Paso? Sat down with a notebook and wrote down everything that went wrong. Not to beat ourselves up—though there was some of that—but to build a system that would beat those problems before they could beat us. 
The list was embarrassing: 
	•	Jackhammer: Dead on arrival 
	•	Backup for jackhammer: Didn't have one 
	•	Right-sized equipment: half the size we needed 
	•	Concrete saw: Only had “old blue” 
	•	Backup saw: Nope 
	•	Hydraulic line: Burst at hour 20 
	•	Replacement line: Didn't exist 
	•	Sewer line location: Unknown 
	•	Contingency for sewer line: Hope and prayer 
	•	Concrete pump company: Canceled at the last minute 
	•	Backup pump company: Scrambled to find one 
	•	Chain rated for our needs: Didn't have one 
	•	Team exhaustion plan: "Just push through." 
Looking at that list, and it could be longer, you'd think we were amateurs. And maybe we were. But we were amateurs who managed to finish the job. The goal was to turn those amateur contractors into professional preventers.  
The thing is, once you discover the power of systems, it's easy to get drunk on them. You start seeing everything as a problem to optimize.  
Equipment failures? System.  
Scheduling? System.  
Communication? System.  
Which brings me to one of my most spectacular failures - the time I tried to systematize love. 
The Automated Love Disaster 
Let me tell you about a system that worked TOO well. When I first discovered the power of automation. 
I'd been forgetting to text my wife during the day. Not on purpose — I was just buried in work, covered in concrete, the usual. So I found this app that could schedule texts. Brilliant, right? Set it up once, never forget again. 
Every day at 2:17 PM, her phone would buzz: "Hey honey. I love you. Hope you're having a great day." 
Day 1 reply: "That's nice!"  
Day 2: "That's weird, it came at the same time."  
Day 3: "Are you using something to send these automatically?" 
Caught! I thought I was being thoughtful. After all, I'd solved the problem of forgetting to tell her I loved her! I’d optimized it. Made it consistent. Isn't that what matters? 
No. No, it's not! Haha! 
It turns out, when you automate "I love you," what you're really saying is "I love efficiency more than you." My wife didn't want a romantic robot. She wanted her actual husband to remember she existed during the workday. 
What I'd done was turn love into a scheduled task, like setting a reminder to breathe or scheduling playful spontaneity for 3:15 PM sharp. My wife didn't want consistent communication —she wanted actual connection. The system was perfect. The human element was completely missing. She still brings it up. "Remember when you outsourced loving me to an app?" Not my finest moment. But hey, the texts were never late! 
Systems should make life better, not replace humanity. When you automate 'I love you,' you're not being efficient—you're being absent, or maybe you’re being a moron!  
Paranoia That Pays 
Here's the system we built after El Paso: Backup for Your Backup. Need one saw? Bring two. Critical equipment? Have a spare on site. Tight deadline? Build in buffer time. Important supplier? Have two more vetted and ready. 
Sounds excessive? Let me tell you about the job that proved this paranoia pays. 
We got called to an aluminum plant. They melted down aluminum in a giant furnace — this thing is 20 feet in diameter and weighs 100,000 pounds. Some engineer had figured out how to increase production by 20% with one "simple" modification: Rebuild the foundation that it sat on. 
There was only one complication. The plant didn’t want to remove the actual drum of the furnace. Their solution? Remove the foundation and pour it again while working underneath the furnace. Under A. One. Hundred. Thousand. Pound. Furnace.  
Your grandpa had poured the original foundation in the 90s. I was there, but I was pretty young and only remember it vaguely. Now, decades later, we had to remove the top 18 inches of his work and pour a new slab. They created a temporary bridge to suspend the furnace in the air while we worked underneath. 
This job was where the El Paso lessons paid off. One 70 hp saw would have been enough? Great. We still brought two, running side by side. One giant excavator could handle it? Fantastic. We brought two. Every tool, every backup, every contingency covered. 
The plant manager watched us unload equipment like we were preparing for war. "Seems like overkill," he observed. "Overkill is underrated when you're working under 50 tons of furnace," I replied. 
That job, and every job we've done since El Paso, has been flawless. That's not to say every detail went perfectly, but we were ready for every contingency. Saw breaks? Switch to the backup and keep moving. Excavator has unexpected issues? The second one's already warmed up. Key employee calls in sick? Someone else already knows the process. Payment delayed? We've got cash reserves. The leading supplier can't deliver? Our backup vendor is a phone call away. Website crashes? We're already on a different server. 
Backup for Your Backup isn't just about equipment—it's about eliminating single points of failure in every part of your business. It's why we succeeded when others folded during supply chain disruptions. It's why we keep delivering when competitors make excuses. 
The production crew never likes delays. But you know what they want even less? Catastrophic failure. We finished on time, no drama, no heroics—just systematic execution with a backup at every step. As I said before, you don't rise to the occasion —you fall to your level of preparation. And our preparation level after El Paso? Borderline paranoid. Which is precisely where it needs to be. 
Preparation turns pressure into performance. But preparation isn't just about having extra equipment. It's about thinking through failure before failure has a chance to think. 
The Joseph Principle 
Joseph understood systems before we had a word for it. Pharaoh had a dream about seven fat cows eaten by seven skinny cows, and everyone was confused. But God showed Joseph that it was simple: seven years of plenty followed by seven years of famine. Build systems now or starve later. Pharaoh hireed him on the spot. In his position, you put someone with that much wisdom in charge immediately. 
So what does Joseph do? He doesn't just suggest saving some grain. He creates the world's first agricultural surplus system. Takes 20% of everything during the good years. Not 10%, not 30%—precisely what the system could handle without breaking the economy. Storage facilities are in every city. Distribution networks that are ready to activate. Detailed records of everything. They stored so much that they stopped counting it! 
Seven years later, when famine hits, Egypt doesn't just survive—it becomes the wealthiest nation on earth. The surrounding nations come begging for food. Not through luck. Not through last-minute heroics. Through systems built during abundance for the inevitable scarcity. 
You don't build systems during a crisis. You build them in the calm, for the storm you know is coming. 
When Running Everywhere Isn't the Answer 
I figured out the efficiency game young. When I was about 10, walking on a motel's second-story walkway, it suddenly hit me: Walking is slow, running is fast. Why am I walking? 
From that moment on, I ran everywhere. To the ice machine. Back to the room. Around the motel. Across parking lots. My parents probably snickered at my "great discovery," but I was convinced everyone else was wasting time. 
That efficiency obsession shifted to concrete work. I had great teachers in concrete. My Grandpa and my  Dad’s Forman, Steve Hammonds, were true craftsmen of the trade. They were perfectionists and artists. No detail went unnoticed; no flaw left until later.  My grandpa and Steve taught perfectionism, but my Dad taught efficiency: Never walk empty-handed, carry something both ways, do everything in half the steps. There was never a wasted moment. In concrete, this is crucial because when you have a volatile product that dries and hardens regardless of your presence, you can’t afford to waste any effort. My Dad was the king of efficiency. If my Grandpa and Steve could create a fantastic product, my Dad could make 95% of the product quality, but do it in half the steps. 
“Never automate inefficiency. But also: Never systematize the soul out of something” 
Here's what took me another twenty years to learn: Sometimes walking with someone is the whole point. Sometimes the inefficient path—the conversation that meanders, the job that takes longer because you're teaching your kid—that's where the real value lives. 
I still run when it makes sense. But now I know when to walk. 
Never automate inefficiency. But also: Never systematize the soul out of something. Systems should create freedom, not cages. 
The Discipline Dividend 
That aluminum plant job? Finished right on time, no 78-hour marathons.  
They were so impressed that they recommended us for more industrial jobs. Not because we were the cheapest —we weren't. But because we were the most predictable. In production facilities, predictability is priceless. 
Here's what discipline means—something that took me years to understand. When you kids complain about our systems, remember this. The discipline of over-preparation gave us the freedom to handle whatever came up. When a hydraulic line started leaking (because, of course it did), we swapped it in ten minutes. When the first pump company got stuck in traffic, the backup was already on-site. 
“Boring is beautiful when you're running a business.” 
We stopped being the heroes of our disaster movies. Instead of war stories about how we overcame impossible odds, we had boring stories about jobs that went precisely as planned. 
Boring is beautiful when you're running a business. 
Systems for Life, Not Just Concrete 
The systematic thinking that saved our construction business started bleeding into everything else. Once you understand how systems create freedom, you start seeing opportunities everywhere. 
Morning routine? Systematized. Wake up, work out, coffee, same breakfast, same order every day. Does it sound rigid? It's actually liberating. No decisions before coffee means more mental energy for more essential choices later.  
Clothes shopping? I have the ultimate system. The mannequin method. When I need new clothes, which is rare, I walk into the store and buy whatever's on the mannequin. The whole outfit. My size. Done. 
My wife laughed the first time she saw me do it: "You know you can mix and match, right?" I say: "Why would I?” Someone who knows fashion has already solved this problem. They put their best answer on display. I'm just leveraging their expertise. 
Einstein said, “Make things as simple as possible but no simpler.” The mannequin method is exactly simple enough; it's repeatable, transferable, and consistently delivers results. If I had to analyze fashion trends, mix and match pieces, or understand color theory every time I needed clothes, I'd either waste hours or never buy anything. Simple systems create freedom. Complex systems create paralysis. 
Email? Template responses for common questions. Standard texts like my address or email? Text replacement shortcuts. Kid pickup schedules? Automated reminders. Date nights with your mom? Scheduled weekly. Bill paying? Autopay everything possible. 
This even extends to conversations. I keep a running list of things to discuss with your mom. Not because I'm a robot, but because essential topics get lost in the daily chaos without a system to catch them. (I’ll admit that one makes me sound like a robot) The funny part is that your mom brought a list to date night first. Maybe I'm finally rubbing off on her! Don't get your hopes up—every great relationship has to balance itself out. 
But you know what? We never miss date night. We never forget to discuss important decisions. We never let the urgent crowd out the important. The system handles the logistics so we can focus on each other. 
The Hidden Cost of No Systems 
Here's what running without systems costs: 
Mental Energy: Every decision made from scratch drains your battery. What tools to bring? Decision. What to do when something breaks? Decision. How to handle client questions? Decision. By noon, you're mentally exhausted from decisions that should have been made in advance. 
Inconsistent Results: Sometimes you remember the backup saw. Sometimes you don't. Sometimes you check the sewer lines. Sometimes you hit them. Your success becomes a dice roll. 
Team Confusion: Without systems, every job is an adventure—and not the good and fun kind. Your team never knows what to expect, so they can't prepare properly. 
Reputation Roulette: One day, you're heroes who overcame impossible odds. The next day, you're the contractor who couldn't deliver. Clients want boring reliability, not exciting uncertainty. 
Growth Ceiling: You can't scale chaos. Without systems, you're limited to what you can personally manage. With systems, you can hand someone a checklist and trust the outcome. 
Your Systems Start Now 
Small daily improvements compound into big results. The plans of the diligent lead surely to abundance, but everyone who is hasty comes only to poverty. — Proverbs 21:5  You don't need to systematize your entire life tomorrow. Start with one thing. One repeated task that drains your energy or creates uncertainty. 
The S.T.A.R.T. Method: 
	•	Select one struggle (What's draining you?) 
	•	Trace the steps (Write down the current process) 
	•	Apply for one week (Test your system) 
	•	Refine what works (Adjust based on results) 
	•	Tackle the next one (Build momentum) 
Systems aren't something new—they're ancient wisdom dressed in modern language. They've been the secret of success since the beginning of time. 
Look at creation itself. God didn't randomly throw together the universe. He systematically built it, layer by layer. Light first, then sky and water, then land, then vegetation, then creatures. Each day is built on the previous one. That's a system. 
Noah didn't just nail boards together when the rain started. He had specifications, measurements, and a systematic approach to building something that had never existed before. Moses didn't wander into Pharaoh's court and wing it—God gave him a step-by-step system for the plagues, each one escalating systematically. 
Your great-grandfather had systems—he just called them "the way we do things." Your grandpa times every green light on his routes. Your mom sets the coffee maker every single night before bed, so mornings run smoothly. These aren't fancy productivity hacks. They're timeless wisdom about making life work. 
The Babylonians had systems for irrigation. The Romans had systems for building roads that still exist today. Every prosperous civilization, every thriving business, every functioning family runs on systems—whether they call them that or not. 
Maybe it's: 
	•	Your morning routine (What would happen if you didn't have to think before coffee? Your mom always sets the coffee maker the night before. ) 
	•	Your work preparation (What's your Pre-Job Audit?) 
	•	Your communication (What questions do you answer over and over?) 
	•	Your finances (What if paying bills wasn't a monthly scramble?) 
	•	Your health (What if exercise was automatic, not negotiable?) 
Pick one. Write down the steps. Test it for a week. Adjust what doesn't work. Then pick another. 
Remember: Rest is productive. And systems create rest. Not the lying-on-the-couch rest (though that's nice too). The mental rest that comes from not having to remake the same decisions every day. The professional rest that comes from knowing your backup plans have backup plans. The financial rest that comes from predictable success instead of heroic surprises. 
The System That Saves You From Yourself 
You need systems the most when you want them least. When you're tired, stressed, overwhelmed—that's when systems save you. When your brain is screaming, "just wing it," your system quietly says, "we've already solved this." 
One of the younger guys asked me once, "Don't you miss the excitement? The adrenaline?" I thought about El Paso. About 78 hours of work in four days. About watching that chain stretch while pulling a 48,000-pound forklift with equipment rated for maybe half that. "No," I said. "I don't." Choose discipline now or regret later. We chose boring. Best choice we ever made. 
“Heroes are exciting. Professionals are rich.” 
After El Paso, we could have just tried harder. We could have worked longer hours, been more careful, and hoped for better luck. Instead, we built systems that made luck irrelevant. 
Your El Paso is coming. Maybe it's already here. The moment when everything breaks at once and you realize that heroic effort isn't sustainable. That's your system moment. That's when you decide whether you want to be a hero or a professional. Heroes are exciting. Professionals are rich. 
The skills you have and acquire are all that are truly yours. And the skill of building systems—of solving problems once instead of repeatedly—that's the skill that multiplies all your other skills. 
So here's your assignment: What broke recently in your life? What required heroic effort to fix? What made you think "never again"? That's where your first system lives. In the gap between "never again" and "here we go again." 
Build something boring. Build something that makes your life predictable. Build something that saves you from yourself. Because the next time everything breaks at once—and it will—you won't need to be a hero. 
You'll just need to follow the system. 
And that, more than any amount of talent or luck or heroic effort, is what will set you free.

Systems Work Great—Until You Realize You've Become a Robot 
So now you have systems. Your business runs like clockwork. Your morning routine is automated. Even your wardrobe decisions are systematized. You've become a productivity machine, optimizing every minute, maximizing every opportunity. 
But what happens when your wife walks into your perfectly organized office, sits down across from your immaculate desk, and says, "I feel like I'm married to a spreadsheet"? 
What happens when your kids say, "Dad's always working on his systems"? 
What happens when you realize you've optimized everything except the one thing that matters? 
You can systematize your way to success and still fail at life. You can optimize every process and still miss every moment. You can build the perfect business machine and forget to build relationships with the people you're creating it for. 
I learned this the hard way. Want to know how a robot learns to be human? How efficiency meets love? How systems serve connection instead of replacing it? 
Then let me tell you about the time I tried to optimize a golf cart ride with your mom…  

The Truth in 5 Minutes
Heroes are exciting. Professionals are rich.
After El Paso—78 hours of heroic effort that nearly killed us—I made a promise: Never again. Not "never again will equipment fail." But never again would we be caught without backup plans for our backup plans. Because you don't rise to the occasion. You fall to your level of preparation.
Now we bring two saws when one would work. Every tool has a spare. Every process has documentation. We stopped being heroes and became boring. Best decision we ever made.
Every repeated problem is a system begging to be built.
Right now, you're being a hero somewhere—solving the same problems over and over, answering the same questions, fighting the same fires. That's not strength. That's the absence of systems. Discipline equals freedom. The more systems you build, the less willpower you need.
Your 5-Minute Action Plan:
Name your repeat offender (2 min): What problem did you solve this week that you've solved before? What question do you answer repeatedly? Where are you constantly playing hero?
Trace the pattern (2 min): When does this problem arise? What's always missing? What would prevent it from happening again? What's the simplest possible fix?
Act before you sleep (1 min): Design your first system. Not perfect, just functional. Three steps or fewer. Who does what, when. Write it down right now.
But here's the catch—I also tried to systematize love. Scheduled "I love you" texts at 2:17 PM daily. My wife caught on by day three. Turns out, when you automate "I love you," what you're really saying is "I love efficiency more than you." Systems should create freedom, not cages.
The Builder's Formula at Work: ACTION + PERSISTENCE Systems require both Action (building them) and Persistence (maintaining them). El Paso taught us that systems let you persist when motivation fails.
Before You Move On: Implement that simple system tomorrow. Just once. Don't wait for perfection—you'll refine through use. Remember: The goal isn't to become a robot. It's to stop wasting energy on solved problems so you can tackle new ones.
 	








Chapter 5:  
The Connection Multiplier 
 
"My loyalty to my team is beyond reproach. I will humbly serve my fellow man and teammate, always ready to defend those who are unable to defend themselves. I do not seek recognition for my actions, and I will place the welfare of others before my own."  
—From The Builder's Creed 
Early in my marriage, we had a lifted golf cart and would ride it around in the river bottom. At a particular spot, there was this 10 or 12-foot hill we could almost make. Almost. 
I had the brilliant solution: I told your mom, "Hey, why don't you jump out? I think I can make it without the extra weight." 
She thought I was joking. I wasn't. 
She got out—not to help, but to walk home alone. Young and dumb, I didn't chase her immediately. I was too busy calculating the improved weight distribution and optimal approach angle for my now-lighter vehicle. 
I made it to the top of that hill. Alone. Which, it turned out, was precisely the problem. 
The Vulcan Years 
Your mom called me her Vulcan. I took it as a compliment. Spock was the smartest one on the Enterprise, right? He made all of his decisions based on data. Spock never let his or anyone else's feelings cloud his judgment. He displayed maximum efficiency in all things. 
What I missed—what took me way too long to understand—was that she wasn't complimenting me. She was telling me, as lovingly as possible, that I was missing the point of being human. 
Part of it was that I simply hadn't learned how to be better at social things yet. I didn't have the tools. Remember those automated texts from Chapter 4? That was just the tip of the efficiency iceberg. I'd optimized everything—work, systems, even relationships. The human element wasn't just missing; I'd actively removed it in the name of productivity. 
She still calls me her Vulcan sometimes. But back then, it wasn't a joke. It was a diagnosis. 
The Social Robot's Awakening 
In my thirties, I finally admitted something everyone around me already knew: I was a social robot. Someone who'd once been the quiet, shy kid had grown into the efficient, emotionless adult. "I'm just not naturally social," I told myself, like it was a blood type or eye color. Unchangeable. 
Then I discovered Vanessa Van Edwards. She called herself a "recovering awkward person" in her book Cues. Wait. Recovering? As in, people can recover from this? I learned from her work that charisma wasn't some genetic gift—it was a learnable skill. Like she said, anyone could develop it with practice and awareness. 
It was as if someone had told me I could somehow learn to see a new color. Social skills weren't genetic. They were learnable. Like pouring concrete or building systems. Just... squishier. I love learning new things, and this was exciting. A whole new skill set to master? Sign me up. 
I started with the absolute basics. First came what I call the punctuation revolution. My texts had always been brutally efficient: "Meeting at 3," "Job complete," "Home late". No frills. So, I decided to force myself to add enthusiasm: "Meeting at 3!" "Job complete!" "Home late!" 
That exclamation point felt like a lie every time I typed it. Who gets excited about meetings? I had no emotion about it. But something strange happened. People responded differently. Warmer. Like I'd suddenly become human. 
My messages became longer, too. Instead of "home late," I'd write "Hey, I'll be home later, but I'm excited to see you!" Those extra words—they mattered more than I'd realized. 
"Did someone hack your phone?" friends asked. "Are you feeling okay?" "You seem... different." Different. Because I'd added punctuation and actual sentences. 
Next came emojis. Those little hieroglyphics that made no logical sense. Why send a smiley face when the words already convey the information? But I forced myself. Meeting at 3! 😊. Job complete! 💪. Home late but excited to see you! 😅.  
My phone felt like it belonged to a teenager. But responses came faster. Conversations lasted longer. People seemed... happier to hear from me? 
Then the real challenge: "LOL." I despised it. I didn't understand why someone would use it, especially since they weren't actually laughing out loud. It felt like the biggest lie of all. But I forced myself to type those three letters when something was mildly amusing. At first, it felt like betraying everything I stood for. Then something weird happened—typing LOL made things funnier. My brain was tricking itself into feeling what I was faking. 
The hardest part was learning to ask "How was your weekend?" and then—this was the killer—listen to the answer. Not, scan for keywords while planning my response. Not calculate how long this social ritual would take. Just... listen. 
"It was good! I took the kids to the lake." Old me: "Cool." (Conversation over.) New me: "Nice! Which lake? Did they swim?" Twenty extra seconds. That's all. But those twenty seconds said, "I see you as a human, not an obstacle between me and efficiency." 
The Signs Showed Up Early 
Looking back, I shouldn't have been surprised that I became a robot. The programming started early.  
When I was around nine, I was the kid who literally couldn't look away from a screen. If the TV was on, I was gone—absorbed completely, deaf to the world around me. My parents would have to stand directly in front of the TV to get my attention. Even then, I'd try to look around them. They tried limiting my time—weekend cartoons only, then outside. But moderation wasn't in my vocabulary when it came to that glowing box. I'd figured out that if I sat in just the right spot in the kitchen, I could see the TV in the living room while "eating breakfast" for two hours. 
This wasn't some junky old TV either. Dad had spent $1,000 on it—an astronomical amount in the late '80s. The salesman had bragged that he built the best TVs, period. Remote control, all the channels, every feature. It was THE TV. Dad had saved for months to buy it, back when a thousand dollars was more than most people made in a month.  
Then one day, my parents made a decision that everyone said was crazy: They got rid of it entirely. Family and friends thought they'd lost their minds. "The kids will suffer!" "You're depriving them!" "How will they relate to other kids?" "You paid $1,000 for that TV!" 
I remember the day they carried it out. My brother and I stood in the living room, staring at the empty entertainment center like someone had died. The square where it used to sit—I could still see the outline in the carpet. Mom and Dad gathered us in that now-empty space. We held hands—and Dad said, "We're going to pray that God fills this hole with something better." 
At nine, standing there holding hands where my cartoons used to live, I thought this was the worst thing that could happen. How would I know what happened to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles? Or Scrooge from Duck Tales? What would I do on Saturday mornings? What would I stare at? 
What I got instead was a different addiction: books. Every week, Dad took us to the Peoria library. I'd leave with a stack so tall I could barely see over it—science fiction mostly—anything with spaceships, quasars, or intergalactic battles. I devoured every sci-fi book they had, living in worlds created by words instead of pixels. Instead of zoning out to the TV, we had actual dinner conversations. Instead of Saturday morning cartoons, I had Saturday morning bike rides to inspect my latest fort construction. My imagination had to work for entertainment instead of having it spoon-fed in 30-minute segments. But here's the thing—that TV zombie never really died. He just went dormant. 
Fast forward twenty years. I'm at dinner with your mom, back when she was just my girlfriend. Cool sports bar—the kind with a TV on every wall.  I'm trying my best to be present, to show her I'm not the robot she's starting to suspect I am. 
There's a TV on the far wall, positioned just above her head from where I'm sitting. From my point of view, the TV looked like it was sitting on her head. It's playing a logging competition—grown men with chainsaws racing to cut through massive logs, chopping trees, climbing poles. Man stuff. The kind of competition where every contestant could probably bench press a truck. I'm nodding along to whatever she's saying, but my eyes keep drifting up. They're climbing trees with spike boots. Speed-cutting with chainsaws, rolling massive logs. It's bizarrely hypnotic. 
"What are you looking at?" she finally asks, turning around to follow my gaze. My eyes snap back to her face. "Uhh..." She spots the TV. "Are you watching a logging show? During our date?" The accusation hangs in the air. This is it. She's going to realize I'm broken. That I literally can't control my attention when there's a screen involved. "Yes," I admit, then quickly add, "but I was listening too!" 
She studies my face for a moment. Then she smiles. "You really can't help it, can you?" "Not really," I confess. "Okay," she says, already standing. "Let's switch seats." What a loving way to respond. We still smile about it to this day.  
Now, whenever we go somewhere, she positions herself between me and any TV. It's become our thing. She knows the nine-year-old TV zombie is still in there, and instead of trying to fix me, she just... accommodates it. Something I’ve learned about connection is that it's not about being perfect. It's about being honest about your imperfections and finding people who help you manage them. 
My parents got rid of the TV to encourage us to connect. They were right—we talked more, read more, played more. But they couldn't remove the tendency from my brain. Thirty years later, I'll still watch competitive logging over a romantic dinner if given the chance. The difference is that now I know it. And more importantly, I married someone who knows it too and loves me anyway—she just makes sure to check the seating arrangement first. 
That prayer in the empty TV space? God did fill it with something better. Books. Imagination. Family dinners. And eventually, a wife who understands that sometimes connection means accepting that the person you love might occasionally get distracted by competitive chainsaw work. But at least now I know to apologize for it. That's growth, right? 
The Chris Voss Education 
One day, I stumbled across an ex-FBI hostage negotiator. This guy had talked down terrorists all over the world, and now he helped people in the private sector have better conversations in business and life. I studied his negotiation techniques, thinking I'd use them for business. But I discovered that his methods for keeping terrorists talking also worked for keeping normal humans in conversation. 
He talked about something called "Mirroring". The idea is to repeat the last few words someone says as a question. For example, let's say they're talking about something that ended with "...to the beach" 
One would reply, in a leading manner, "The beach?" 
Suddenly, they're telling you all about their kids building sandcastles, their sunburn, and their fear of sharks. I wasn't gathering intelligence. I was... caring. I think I always cared—it's just that that care was finally coming across that way. 
Chris's techniques were perfect for me because they also helped to keep other people talking. The more they talked, the less I had to speak. Talk about a win-win for a recovering robot! Besides, almost everyone I've ever met has had something interesting I could learn from them. 
The trick was asking the right questions. Don't ask "What do you do for work?" That usually gets you a job title and a dead conversation. Instead, I love asking people, "What are you doing right now that you're excited about?" Now they're telling you about their passion project, their kid's baseball season, and the garden they're planning. Real stuff. Human stuff. I get to hear a good story, the pressure is off of me to keep the conversation going, and I don't have to talk as much. It's perfect. 
Here's where it got weird: The emotions I was performing eventually started performing themselves. The fake smile became a real one. The forced interest became genuine curiosity. The "LOL" actually made me lighter. 
It's like that concept about physical and psychological states—if a physical state can produce a psychological state, then the reverse is also true. Act interested long enough, and you become interested. Smile enough, and you become happier. By physically going through the motions, I was training my brain to feel the emotions. 
I was like a method actor who forgot he was acting. I played a human for so long that I became one. 
The Ultimate Inefficiency 
The most powerful man in the room got on his knees and washed his disciples' feet. Here's Jesus, hours before crucifixion, and he's doing the servant's job. Peter tries to stop him—it's not efficient, not proper, not optimized for the limited time they have left. 
But Jesus wasn't optimizing. He was connecting. Showing them that authentic leadership sometimes means doing the inefficient thing because relationship matters more than hierarchy. The CEO washing the janitor's feet. The teacher becoming the servant. 
That's what I missed for so many years. I thought leadership meant maximum efficiency. Turns out it means maximum humanity. Sometimes you have to get on your knees, grab the towel, and do the thing that makes no sense on a spreadsheet but makes all the sense in the world to a human heart. 
The Talent Show Test 
The real test of my newfound abilities came at our homeschool co-op talent show. All the kids involved in the co-op were performing something—you kids included. But Mason, being the oldest brother, was graduating that year. All the graduates were to go on stage, and their parents would speak about them in front of the audience. 
As I sat down, your mom leaned over: "Oh, by the way, you'll need to speak about Mason. In front of everyone." 
My brain short-circuited. Other parents were walking up with pages of notes, some crying as they talked about their precious graduates standing there on stage. And then there I am, in my seat, frantically trying to think of the right words, racking my brain for witty sayings, looking at the notes app on my phone, desperate for anything I could use to say when it was my turn to go on stage. I wished I had the time to write something out. I wanted Mason to know I loved him and that I was proud, but my mind was blank and my heart was in my throat. 
When they called my name, I walked up empty-handed. From watching others in my life fumble with the microphone—holding it too far away, or too close, creating that awful feedback screech—I knew just to grab it and talk into it like I owned the place. Because confidence kills nervousness, right? Or at least it hides it. No one thinks less of you if you act confident, and if you act like you belong, why would they think otherwise? 
I stood there with no notes, Mason on stage watching me, heart hammering, face calm. I started talking about him—his strengths, his determination, all the ways he makes me intensely proud. Real stuff. Specific stuff. 
Later, people told me that what I had said was great. Honestly? I don't remember most of it. I was concentrating so hard on looking comfortable that the words just... happened. But Mason heard them, and that's what mattered. 
The Vulcan had learned to feel. Or maybe—and this still amazes me—the feelings were always there, they'd just long been buried under efficiency protocols and optimization algorithms. 
The Marriage Upgrade 
Remember those automated texts? I replaced them with something revolutionary: actual spontaneity. Now, when I think of your mom during the day, I stop what I'm doing and send something real. Maybe a photo of where I am. Or a memory that made me smile. A bad joke I know she'll roll her eyes at. I did have to force it at first, but over time it became a part of me. 
Is it less efficient than automated texts? Absolutely. It takes me thirty seconds instead of zero. But those thirty seconds say "I chose to stop my day for you" instead of "I programmed a computer to remember you exist." 
We have weekly date nights now. Yes, we both have our checklists of things to discuss—it allows us to do other things during the week instead of trying to remember what we want to talk about. The checklist isn't the conversation. It's just the starting point. The real connection happens in the spaces between agenda items. 
“Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor: If either of them falls down, one can help the other up. But pity anyone who falls and has no one to help them up. Also, if two lie down together, they will keep warm. But how can one keep warm alone? Though one may be overpowered, two can defend themselves. A cord of three strands is not quickly broken." — Ecclesiastes 4:9–12 
That's a real connection; working with each other's operating systems instead of against them. She accepts my need for structure. I accept that structure shouldn't replace spontaneity. 
The golf cart incident? We laugh about it now. But it took years to understand what she was trying to tell me that day: The goal wasn't getting to the top of the hill. The goal was to ride together. 
The Fifty-Foot Friendship 
Not all connections start smoothly. Some start so awkwardly that they become legendary. 
The first time I met Israel (now we are best friends), I completely butchered his name. He introduced himself, and I responded with complete incredulity: "ZION?!" Like he'd just told me his parents named him after a biblical mountain. That should have ended it. Most people would have written me off as another awkward church guy who couldn't even get names right. But Israel had other plans. 
A few months later, I was standing in the back of our church gymnasium. Israel was clear across the room—fifty feet away, minimum. We made eye contact. Normal people would nod, maybe wave, then continue their conversations until natural proximity brought them together. 
Not Israel. 
This man raised his hand for a handshake from fifty feet away. Then—and I cannot stress how surreal this was—he kept it extended and power-walked the entire length of that gymnasium, wearing the most determined awkward smile I've ever seen. Like a businessman closing the deal of the century, except the deal was just a customary handshake that could have waited until we were within normal human handshaking distance. 
I stood frozen, watching this handshake march toward me like some sort of social missile. Do I raise my hand now? Wait until he's closer? Run? When he finally reached me, after what felt like a full minute of approach, he grabbed my hand with the satisfaction of someone who'd just summited Everest. "Hey man, how’s it going!" 
 
We still laugh about it. That handshake traveled farther than most Uber rides. But that ridiculous gesture—that commitment to connection despite the awkwardness—that's Israel. And somehow, that fifty-foot handshake turned into one of the most important friendships of my life. 
Sometimes the best relationships start not with perfect chemistry, but with two people willing to be awkward together until it becomes comfortable. Israel taught me that connection doesn't require perfection. It just requires showing up—even if you have to walk fifty feet with your hand out to do it. 
The Connection Paradox 
Here's what messes with my engineer brain: Connection is inefficient by design. It requires: 
	•	Time you could spend producing 
	•	Energy you could spend optimizing 
	•	Attention you could spend planning 
	•	Vulnerability you could spend avoiding 
Connection compounds in ways optimization never could. The contractor I spend the time asking questions about his interests? He will send me referrals. The programmer who knows I care about his ideas? He builds features I never would have thought to request. The kid who gets my attention? He'll remember that moment longer than any efficiently completed Saturday. That’s the power of presence—it compounds like connection does, but only when we choose to show up fully. 
And Presence doesn’t just matter in business; it matters even more at home.  
 There are only so many looks you will get from your kids. When you're at their gymnastics or Jiu-Jitsu practice, and they look over to see if you are watching? There is only a finite number of times they will do that. If they see you talking to the person next to you, or worse, staring at your phone, then they will perceive that as more important than them. Eventually, they won’t even look to see if you noticed anymore. 
  My real breakthrough came when I realized I could learn these things. How to communicate, talk, and understand the nuances of humans. Haha, that makes me sound weird, but seriously, looking people in the eye and making sure they feel heard. That was what made the difference. I had to choose to admit my weaknesses and address them. To look in the mirror and say, "I'm bad at this, but I don't have to stay bad at it." 
Choosing to learn and make myself a better version of myself—that's how you move forward in life. You kids will have to find your weaknesses and address them. Maybe it won't be social skills. Perhaps it will be patience, or organization, or something you haven’t discovered yet. But the process is the same: admit it, learn about it, practice it until it becomes part of you. 
I'm still the guy who buys the whole outfit on the mannequin—still the guy who builds systems for everything. Still the guy who thinks running is more efficient than walking. 
But I'm also the guy who stops to ask how your weekend was. Who sends random pictures to his wife. Who can grab a microphone and speak from the heart about his kids. 
Your mom still calls me her Vulcan sometimes. But now it's our joke. Now there's warmth in it. 
The Formula That Isn't 
If you're like me—and since you're my kids, you might be—you're waiting for the system. The formula. The Seven Steps to Human Connection. The optimization strategy for relationships. 
Here it is: There isn't one. 
Be curious, not judgmental. Be interested, not interesting. Ask questions you want answered. Listen to answers you didn't expect. And here's the most challenging part: Don't think about what you're going to say while they're still talking. Really listen. Let their words land before your response takes off. 
And care about the other person. Have empathy. Try to actually feel what they're feeling, not just understand it intellectually. When someone tells you about their bad day, don't just file it under "information received." Feel a little bit of their frustration. When they share good news, let yourself feel some of their joy. But be wise—most people are good and deserve this energy. The few who aren't? Dust your feet off and move on. Protecting your energy for the right people is part of connection too. 
Doing this might feel like wearing shoes on the wrong feet at first. You might want to optimize. To create templates. To find the shortest path between two points. 
Resist. 
We are all connected. Not through Wi-Fi or systems or perfected communication protocols. But through the messy, inefficient, beautiful practice of actually giving a damn about each other. 
Your Connection Challenge 
Here's your assignment, and it's going to hurt if you're naturally efficient or introverted, or even just selfishly thinking about yourself—but it'll help anyone become more connected: For one week, choose connection over your default mode in every interaction. 
Maybe for you that means: 
	•	Putting your phone down when someone's talking to you (this should be something you always do) 
	•	Asking "how are you?" and waiting for the answer 
	•	Sharing something personal instead of keeping it surface-level 
	•	Making eye contact instead of multitasking 
	•	Saying "tell me more" when you'd usually change the subject 
	•	Choosing to call instead of texting 
	•	Staying present instead of planning your response 
The specifics don't matter. What matters is catching yourself in your default mode—whatever that is—and choosing connection instead. In a world of disconnect, just being what a normal person was a few decades ago makes you stand out today. I don't wear headphones at the gym anymore. I don't want to miss a chance to make a real connection. 
 “In a world of disconnect, just being what a normal person was a few decades ago makes you stand out today.” 
Remember: Kindness never goes out of style. Neither does efficiency, honestly. You'll always need systems and optimization. But they're tools, not identities. The robot in me still calculates the most efficient route to the grocery store. But the human in me stops to chat with the cashier about their day. Both can coexist. Both should coexist. 
Just remember which one drives and which one navigates. 
Because people stand out by connection, not differentiation, they remember you because of how you made them feel. In business, parenting, and leadership, being seen, known, and trusted wins more than just being “unique.” You can be the most efficient person in the world, the most optimized, the most systematized. But if you're riding alone, you're missing the point. 
Be different all you want. Be efficient. Be optimized. Be the best. But first, be connected. 
Because at the top of every hill you climb alone, you'll find the same thing: 
Nobody to share the view with. 
And what's the point of the best view in the world if you're the only one who sees it?

Connection Is Beautiful—But Nothing Grows Without Struggle 
Choosing connection means eventually facing moments that test everything you've learned. Moments when old patterns scream louder than new wisdom. When the pressure mounts and deadlines loom, and that efficient robot inside whispers, "We could solve this faster alone. 
That's when the real test begins. That's when you discover if connection is just another system you've learned, or if it's become who you are. And in those moments—in the crucible of real pressure—you'll find out what all of this struggle to become human was preparing you for. 
Because struggle? Struggle is the price of everything worth having, including the ability to truly connect. 
And that brings us to the most profound lesson I've learned...

Successful people optimize everything except what matters—then wonder why they're successful but alone.
I spent years as a Vulcan, turning every human interaction into an efficiency equation. Automated "I love you" texts. Optimized golf cart rides. Template responses for common questions. I'd systematized connection right out of my life. Your mom wasn't married to me—she was married to my systems.
The trap is subtle. You build systems to create freedom (Chapter 4), but then you become the system. You solve problems so you can focus on people, but then you treat people like problems to solve. You optimize for success and accidentally optimize out joy.
Connection beats optimization because inefficiency is where love lives.
The twenty seconds it takes to ask "How was your weekend?" and actually listen. The "wasted" time sitting with someone who needs presence, not solutions. The fifty-foot handshake that makes no sense but builds a friendship. These inefficiencies aren't bugs in your system—they're the features that make life worth living.
Your 5-Minute Action Plan:
	•	Name your efficiency victim (2 min): Who's getting the optimized version of you instead of the real you? Which relationship is running on autopilot while you focus on "important" things?
	•	Find your connection gap (2 min): What does this person need that efficiency can't provide? When did they last get your full attention, not your leftover energy?
	•	Act before you sleep (1 min): Choose one beautifully inefficient action. A conversation with no agenda. A surprise that serves no purpose but joy. Schedule nothing—just show up.
Every optimization has a cost. Usually, it's paid by the people who matter most. At the top of every hill you climb alone, you'll find the same thing: Nobody to share the view with.
The Builder's Formula at Work: ALL THREE Connection requires Identity (I am someone who values people over productivity), Action (choosing inefficient presence), and Persistence (breaking your own systems for love).
Before You Move On: Do that inefficient thing before tomorrow ends. Not because it's productive, but because it's human. Chapter 6 is about struggle, and the hardest struggle for achievers is choosing love over productivity.
 

Chapter 6:
Struggle Is the Price of Growth

I will never quit. I will persevere and thrive on adversity. My team expects me to be physically harder and mentally stronger than our opponents. If knocked down, I will get back up every single time. I will draw on every remaining ounce of strength to accomplish the mission. I am never out of the fight.
—From The Builder's Creed
Jacob worked seven years for the woman he loved. The Bible says those years "seemed like only a few days to him because of his love for her." Then he gets tricked—he wakes up married to the wrong sister. Then he has to work another seven years for Rachel.
Fourteen years of labor for one bride. Here's what I notice: those fourteen years of struggle made him who he was. Not the wedding. Not the woman. The work. By the time he finally got what he wanted, he'd become someone who could handle it, which was a long way away from who he started as. That's what my dad knew. It was about moving me from who I was to who I needed to become.
Around age 10, my Dad pointed at our irrigation canal and said that he wanted it cleaned out. The entire end of the canal, all the way down. To my kid brain, it stretched forever—a muddy Grand Canyon that surely had no end—one flat shovel. No help. An Arizona sun that could fry eggs on concrete. The reality? It was only about 300 feet long and had a few inches of sand in the bottom.

I spent days in that ditch. Blisters forming, breaking, reforming. Sand in places it shouldn't be. Every muscle screaming. Every shovelful a personal insult. When I finally finished, Dad walked the length of it, inspected my work, and said two words: "Good job."
That's it. Two words. No parade. No bonus allowance. No "sorry I made you dig a ditch for a week." Just an acknowledgment that the work met the standard.
I felt ten feet tall.
The Gift Disguised as Work
That canal taught me something no participation trophy ever could: Real satisfaction comes from real effort. Not from being told you're special. Not from having things made easy. But from moving actual dirt with actual blisters until an actual job is done.
“Growth comes from struggle… The growth part? That sneaks up on you later.”
Looking back now, I see what Dad saw—a soft kid who needed hardening. Not cruel hardening. Purposeful hardening. The kind that turns boys into men who get things done. See, the world doesn't stop when you're uncomfortable. Concrete doesn't wait for you to feel ready. Customers don't care that you're tired. Equipment breaks on Sundays. Suppliers fail at the worst moment. Workers call in sick when you need them most. Dad knew all this, so he prepared me for it. Every push was preparing me for when pushing through would be the only option. 
Growth comes from struggle, but when you're young and covered in sand, it just feels like struggle. The growth part? That sneaks up on you later, usually when you're facing something that would have broken the pre-ditch version of you.
James knew it when he said, “Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything." — James 1:2–4
The Christmas Tree That Taught Perspective
Not every struggle teaches what you expect. Sometimes it teaches you about the complexity of provision.
When I was in second grade, we had no money for a Christmas tree. Mom took me and my brother walking through the desert, searching for the perfect greasewood bush. It had to have a single trunk—that was crucial, or it wouldn't fit in the tree stand.
We walked for what felt like hours and miles. In reality, it was probably 45 minutes and one mile, but to a second-grader's legs in desert sand, it might as well have been a cross-country expedition. Then we saw it. Our tree. Standing alone on a small hill, backlit by the afternoon sun like something out of a Christmas special. In my memory, a choir of angels sang as we approached. It was perfect—single trunk, full branches, just the right height.
We cut it down with Dad's old saw and dragged it home like we'd conquered a mountain summit. We set it up in the living room, strung lights, and hung our homemade ornaments. I couldn't wait for Dad to come home and see what we'd found. Except Dad had worked extra jobs that week, saved just enough for a surprise—a real pine tree from the lot in town. He walked in carrying this perfect pine, face glowing with pride at providing something special for his family. His smile faltered when he saw our greasewood already set up, decorated, with his family sitting around it.
I wanted to be excited about his tree. It smelled like Christmas. It looked like the trees on TV. But I also wanted him to love our greasewood, to see the adventure we'd had finding it, to understand that it was already perfect because we'd chosen it together.
We used his pine tree. Of course we did. But something in me has always felt sad about that greasewood, left outside to dry in the desert sun. It taught me that sometimes the struggle to provide means missing the provision in what you already have.
Now, when you kids show me something you've worked for—even if I could buy you something "better"—I remember that greasewood. Sometimes the gift isn't the thing itself. It's the story of getting it.
The Great Mower "Tragedy"
When I was around 12, Grandma's riding mower "mysteriously" broke—just stopped working one day. No explanation. No timeline for repair. Just me, my brother, and half an acre of grass that grew like it was on steroids.
"Guess you'll have to use the push mower," Dad said, like it was no big deal.
To a 12-year-old who thought he was going to ride that mower like a go-kart, this was devastating. A tragedy of epic proportions. Half an acre with a push mower? In Arizona heat? It might as well have been the Sahara Desert.
I remember that first mowing session after the riding mower died—hours of pushing, sweating, and frequent water breaks. My hands blistered. My shoulders burned.
Then something happened. After a few weeks, it wasn't that bad. My hands toughened up. I found a rhythm. Started racing myself to beat previous times. What felt like punishment became just... normal.
Looking back now, I'm 99% sure that mower wasn't broken. Pretty sure Grandma and Dad had a conversation that went something like, "These boys are getting soft."
And you know what? When you push that mower around our yard today, you're learning the same lesson I learned thirty years ago. Different mower, same sweat, same blisters, same transformation. Funny how some things never really "break"—they just teach different lessons to other generations.
The Concrete Kid Chronicles
The canal was just the beginning. Somewhere around the age of 5, Dad would take us to job sites with him. We would start before dawn. Payment? A donut and chocolate milk from the local shop. I didn't know other kids were sleeping in on Saturdays. Chocolate milk, doughnuts, and hanging out with dad! I loved it! I had no use for money. That donut was everything.
Years later, we were still helping my dad. Whenever he would bring his trailer full of dirt home, we would be out back unloading it. This wasn't just busywork. Dad would come home from working all day, his truck bed loaded with dirt and landscape rock that he had dug out for the patio that was to be poured the next day. Every time he brought it home, we'd shovel it all out—rock, dirt, debris. It had to be empty for the next day's job. While other kids watched cartoons after school, we were in the back pasture with shovels, clearing that day's work so tomorrow could happen.
Looking back, I see what Dad was teaching us: Your limits aren't where you think they are. That canal showed me I had more hours in me than I knew. Those trailers full of dirt proved I was stronger than I believed. And those achy muscles? Every aching muscle proved we hadn't found our edge yet.
If who I am today comes from what I've endured in the past—if every success traces back to some struggle I overcame—then why wouldn't I give you the same gift? Not because I enjoy watching you struggle, but because I know what waits on the other side of it: a version of you that can handle whatever life throws at you.
Think about it: Every capability I have today traces back to some struggle I didn't want to face. The ability to work 78 hours straight in El Paso? That started with a canal and a shovel. The discipline to build multiple businesses? That began with emptying Dad's trailer every single evening. The mental toughness to lose a house and start over? That was forged through a thousand smaller defeats and recoveries.
 “Struggle isn't punishment. It's preparation”
I could shield you from all of this. I have the money now. I could hire people to do your chores, buy you whatever you want (well, maybe not anything you want), smooth every road, and remove every obstacle. Plenty of successful parents do exactly that. They worked themselves raw so their kids would never have to.
But then I look at those kids—soft, entitled, crumbling at the first real challenge. And I realize the cruelest thing I could do is rob you of your struggles. Because struggle isn't punishment, it's preparation. It's the only way to build the kind of strength that nobody can take away from you.
So yes, I make you work. Yes, I let you fail. Yes, I watch you struggle with things I could easily fix. Not because I'm cruel, but because I'm playing the long game. I'm not raising children—I'm building adults. Adults who won't fold when life gets hard. Adults who know that every struggle has an end, and they have what it takes to reach it.
The Day I Chose Not to Win
Arm wrestling my Grandpa was a rite of passage for all nine of us boy cousins. One by one, we'd line up at family gatherings, each convinced we'd be the one to beat him finally. He was a meat cutter and concrete finisher—his forearms looked like bridge cables, his hands like leather mittens. He'd beat us all, then flex and grin like he'd won the heavyweight championship. We'd walk away defeated but already planning our training regimen for next time.
By fifteen, I'd filled out from all the concrete work. My hands had their own calluses. I'd been visualizing this moment for years—the day I'd finally beat Grandpa at arm wrestling. We sat down across from each other at Grandma's kitchen table. Inside the barn he had turned into a home. The exact spot where he'd beaten me dozens of times before.
I wrapped my hand around his—still smaller, but not by as much anymore. Looked him in the eyes. He had an infectious grin, ear to ear. I could see love, pride, and joy. I can imagine myself in the same position one day. "Ready?" He said as he tensed his muscles, "Three, two, one—"
I put everything I had into it. Every canal I'd dug, every trailer I'd emptied, every bag of concrete I'd carried—all of it flowed into my arm. And slowly, incredibly, his hand started moving backward. I was winning. That's when it hit me: I didn't want to win. Immediately, like a kick in the gut. Not like this. Not against him. Some victories aren't worth having. I eased off just enough. Let him push back. Let him win like he always had. His victory flex was smaller that day, his grin a little forced. I think he might have known what had happened. Neither of us said anything. 
I never rechallenged him. It was something intangible—I still can't find the right words for it. I just knew I didn't want to win at his expense. Maybe it’s that some things are worth more than winning. Respect. Legacy.
My Biggest Regret
My biggest regret isn't about something I did. It's about something I didn't do. Grandpa's funeral was packed. He'd touched so many lives—every contractor he'd worked with, every family he'd poured concrete for, every person who'd experienced his huge smile and bigger heart.
My dad spoke beautifully. Told stories about learning the trade, about Grandpa's work ethic, about the legacy he'd built. He has always been great at going to people and saying the right things. I’ve heard him at many events, and he always has the right words to say. It is something I’ve always admired and even been a little jealous of, and maybe apprehensive is a good word too. I know that someday I will need to take his place, be the one who says the right words in the uncomfortable setting, be the example for others. 
A few other people shared their memories—funny stories, touching moments, life lessons learned. Then they asked if anyone else wanted to speak. I was screaming inside. I had so many stories bursting to get out; the work he had supervised while teaching me persistence, the fifty-dollar tailgate lessons, the way he'd shown up to every important moment, always with that smile that could light up any room. I knew that everyone else had the same fantastic stories, and they all wanted to share them. 
But I sat there. Frozen. The oldest grandchild, the one who'd worked with him longest, who had the most stories, the one who should set the example—and I couldn't make myself stand up. My throat closed. My legs wouldn't move. The moment passed. The service continued. The chance disappeared forever.
I've replayed that moment a thousand times. What I would have said. How I would have honored him. The stories that died with my silence. Today I speak at everything. Uncomfortable or not. Prepared or not. Because the pain of speaking will never compare to the pain of staying silent when it matters. That regret became my teacher—sometimes the struggles that shape us most are the ones where we failed to act.
The Success Formula Nobody Wants
Here's what I've noticed after years of running businesses alongside other successful fathers: Many of us struggle with the same paradox. We tell stories about how hard our dads were on us, how much we had to work, how nothing was handed to us. Those struggles made us who we are. Then we look at our kids and think, "I want them to have it easier than I did."
It's a noble thought that comes from love. We remember the pain, the exhaustion, the times we wished things were different. And we promise ourselves our kids won't have to feel that way. But here's what I've learned—and what I'm still learning: The ability to keep going, to push through pain, only comes from actually pushing through pain. It's like watching a chick hatch from an egg. If you help break the shell, the struggle that would have strengthened them is stolen. They emerge weaker, not stronger.
That puts me in a rather tricky position as a father. If I truly love you, then I have to let you struggle sometimes. I have to watch you fail, let you experience frustration, allow you to go through challenges—because if I remove every obstacle, I'm not protecting you. I'm preventing you from developing the strength you'll need when I'm not there to help. Character needs struggle, and growth needs opposition.
It's one of the most complex parts of being a parent—knowing when to step in and when to step back. It would be so much easier in the short run to smooth out the bumps in front of you, but smooth paths don't build strong travelers.
The September 1st Lesson in Necessary Loss
Fast forward to September 1st, 2010. We'd just lost our house after fighting for two years to save it. We moved to a rental with four kids, bruised credit, and empty bank accounts. It should have been our lowest point.
I woke up that morning feeling... nothing. No depression, no anxiety. For the first time in two years, the weight was gone. Just that light feeling where you hear birds chirping and the color of the sunrise. As I drove to buy coffee beans and bagels, I realized something: We'd followed every rule and lost anyway. 
"…because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope. And hope does not put us to shame, because God’s love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us." — Romans 5:3–5 (NIV)
That rental became our happiest home. No mortgage hanging over us. No fighting to save something already lost. Just us, together, with nothing to lose and everything to build. The struggle wasn't losing the house. The struggle was admitting we needed to lose it. Once we did, we were free.
The struggle of losing the house was rough. My brother told me that during that time, when we were losing the house, I was hard to be around and work with—Grumpy, short, and moody. But the things I learned from the struggle were to carry me through the rest of my life. The lessons carried on to the next struggle.
I need to be honest —that experience also limited me. It made me so afraid of losing again, so risk-averse, that for years I had a hard time taking chances on new things. I'd learned to survive struggle, but I'd also learned to avoid it. Took the safe path, the sure thing, the guaranteed paycheck. It worked, but it took significantly longer to build what I could have built if I hadn't been so scared of a repeat of losing everything.
Sometimes struggle teaches you to push through. Sometimes it teaches you to pull back. The wisdom is knowing which lesson to keep and which one to let go.
The Professional Development Program of Pain
Every struggle is a skill acquisition program. The skills you have and acquire? They're all that are truly yours. Nobody can repo your abilities. They can't foreclose on your experience. The market can't crash your competence.
Every struggle teaches something specific:
	•	The canal taught persistence
	•	Concrete work taught precision
	•	El Paso taught preparation
	•	House loss taught perspective
	•	Business building teaches everything
You can't download these skills. Can't buy them. Can't inherit them. You have to earn them through the ancient currency of struggle.
I'm not trying to make you repeat my exact struggles. The canal I dug taught me persistence. Now you need to find your canal—maybe it's building your first app, or leading your first team, or solving a problem I never had to. My struggles carried me from my father to here. Your struggles should take you from here to heights I'll never reach.
That's why I'm writing this book. Not so you can avoid struggle, but so you can choose better struggles. Bigger struggles. Struggles that build on what I've learned instead of starting from scratch. I fought to build businesses. Maybe you'll fight to build empires. I learned to manage hundreds of people. Perhaps you'll lead thousands.
The foundation I'm giving you—through work, through these truths, through letting you struggle while I'm here to guide you—that's your launching pad. Not your ceiling. The point is this: Don't avoid the struggle. Embrace it. The struggle is where all the growth happens. It's where you discover what you're made of. Every time you want to quit but don't, every time you push through when pushing through seems impossible, you're building strength that no one can take away from you. 
The Inheritance of Grit
I watch successful parents shield their kids from every discomfort, then wonder why their children can't handle basic challenges. They've stolen their children's struggles—and with them, their strength.
You kids work with me like I worked with my parents. Not because I'm cruel. Because I'm kind enough to let you struggle now while the stakes are low, and I'm here to guide you.
You'll thank me later. Or you won't. Doesn't matter. What matters is that when your El Paso moment comes—and it will—you'll have canal-digging calluses on your character. Mom's job is to make you feel loved; my job is to love you by letting you feel pain. Haha, that sounds cruel. Seriously though, all the motivational speeches in the world won't replace one honest day of struggle. All the participation trophies won't equal one "good job" earned through actual effort.
 “Winners are just people who refused to become quitters.”
You want to know the difference between the people who make it and the people who don't? Those who succeed learn to grow from whatever struggles come their way. They find the lesson in losing the house. They discover strength in the ditch. They extract wisdom from failure. The ones who don't? They just suffer. They dig the same ditch over and over in their minds, learning nothing, growing nowhere. They spend their whole lives bitter about having to dig that first canal, not realizing they're still standing in it thirty years later.
The people who win never quit. That's it. That's the whole secret. They might get knocked down, they might take longer than expected, they might have to find a different path—but they never stop moving forward. Winners are just people who refused to become quitters.

Personal Growth Has Limits—What If You Built Bigger?
When you choose struggle, eventually you move from struggling alone to building something bigger than yourself. You realize that your personal growth was never just about you—it was preparing you to lift others.
That canal I dug at 10? It wasn't just teaching me to work. It was teaching me to build. And once you know how to build through struggle, you start seeing opportunities everywhere. Not just to grow yourself, but to create foundations others can stand on.
Which brings us to the difference between building for success and building for succession. Between creating wealth and creating a legacy. Between winning alone and ensuring everyone wins.
Want to know how two construction companies and eight kids forced me to think bigger than I'd ever imagined?
Then let me tell you about the math problem that changed everything...

The Truth in 5 Minutes
Most people fail in one of two ways: They avoid all struggle, or they choose the wrong struggles.
That canal I dug at 10? My dad didn't make me dig it because he was cruel. He made me dig it because he knew something I didn't—that every capability I'd ever have would trace back to some struggle I didn't want to face. The ability to work 78 hours in El Paso started with a shovel and sand at age 10.
Not all struggle creates strength. Some people dig the same emotional ditches for decades, learning nothing. They confuse suffering with growth, drama with development. They're professional strugglers who never actually build anything.

Growth comes from struggle—but only when you choose the right struggle.
The difference is intention. A canal with a purpose builds character. A hole with no point just wastes time. Productive struggle has an endpoint, teaches specific skills, builds toward something bigger. Pointless suffering just hurts. One forges capability. The other just leaves scars.
Your 5-Minute Action Plan:
	•	Name your avoidance (2 min): What growth are you dodging because it's hard? Where are you choosing comfort over capability? What would you attempt if struggle was the point, not the problem?
	•	Identify your pointless pain (2 min): What are you struggling with that builds nothing? Where do you create drama instead of growth? Which battles are ego, not evolution?
	•	Act before you sleep (1 min): Choose one productive struggle. Hard enough to change you, focused enough to complete. Set a deadline. Tell someone who'll hold you accountable.
The question isn't whether you'll struggle—you will. The question is whether your struggle will build strength or just mark time. Choose wisely. Your future capabilities depend on today's chosen pain.
The Builder's Formula at Work: PERSISTENCE This chapter is Persistence in its purest form. Every story shows the third principle—never stopping, especially when it hurts.
Before You Move On: Start your productive struggle within 48 hours. Not the safe challenge—the one that scares you. The one that will fundamentally upgrade who you are. Because Chapter 7 is about building bigger than yourself, and you can't lift others until you've built your own strength.

Chapter 7:
Build Bigger Than Yourself

"I accept the responsibility that is bestowed upon me, and I understand that my chosen way of life is a privilege that I must earn every day. I will serve with honor on and off the battlefield of life."
—From The Builder's Creed
By 2020, we were successful by any standard measure. We had our general contractor license, a good three years of running our manufactured home dealership, and money in the bank. I was working hard, just as I always had. But something was gnawing at me. 
I realized I'd been focused on everyone else's definition of success instead of building toward my own. Income does not far exceed personal development, and I'd hit my ceiling. Not financially—personally. I was happy but not content. There's a difference. Happy means you're grateful for what you have. Content means you're done growing. And I wasn't done.
What drove me was watching all of you grow up. I wanted you to work with me like I'd worked with my parents, learning the business from the ground up. That's how God intended families to operate— as multiple generations building together. There's wisdom only a grandparent can pass down. I could lecture you about patience until I'm blue in the face, but when Grandma takes a toddler on a walk and stops to watch every butterfly, that teaches something that no parent rushing to the next appointment ever could.
Between the two of us, my brother and I have eight kids and two construction companies. To create management positions for everyone, we'd have to blow up our entire business model. We'd built these companies to be highly efficient, niched down, specific. We didn't want to become a bloated corporation just to create titles for our kids.
So I had two choices: expand what we had into something we didn't want, or start something new.
The Fourth Generation Problem
That's when a successful friend mentioned Playa Bowls. "Acai bowls?" I said. "We build foundations, not bowls."
"Exactly," he replied. "Different industry, same principles.” Here's the beauty of a franchise—for a small fee, you skip the startup phase where all the pain lives and jump straight to the profitable part.
He was right. The franchise model allowed us to leverage our existing business knowledge without reinventing the wheel. We secured the rights to 10 locations in the West Valley. Every one of you kids will have a chance to work there, to learn the business from the ground up. My hope? You'll work your way up and become partners in it, just like I did with Grandpa in construction.
But Playa Bowls was just the beginning of thinking bigger. Because I was starting to understand something crucial about generational wealth... The statistics of family businesses are brutal. Only around 3% make it to the fourth generation. Three percent! The other 97% die from what I call "legacy rot"—that slow decay where vision turns to complacency, discipline becomes entitlement, and unity fractures into "what's mine." 
"A good man leaves an inheritance to his children's children, but a sinner's wealth is stored up for the righteous." — Proverbs 13:22
My grandpa started with a pickaxe and pure will. Just a man who could outwork anyone and turn dirt into dollars. That's the first generation—all muscle and determination.
My dad took that foundation and built Record Construction from nothing. He transformed sweat into systems and jobs into a business. That's the second generation—taking what was started and making it real. 
My brother and I? We inherited a well-established business, and we expanded its scope. We're the third generation—the ones who either multiply or squander what we've been given. 
But you kids? You're the fourth generation, and that question mark after your names motivates me. Because I've seen the pattern happen to other families. The founder builds it, the son grows it, the grandson enjoys it, and the great-grandson loses it. It's like clockwork. The comfortable inheriting from the capable until there's nothing left but stories about what used to be. 
There's a cycle that explains exactly what I'm talking about: Hard times create strong men. Strong men create good times. Good times create weak men. Weak men create hard times. Four generations. You see it in families, businesses, empires—anywhere comfort replaces struggle. And right now, you are standing at the crossroads where most families fail. 
The reality that drives every decision I make is that I take complete ownership of whether you make it or not. The fourth generation's success or failure is directly related to the energy I pour into you now, into the thought and effort I apply to raising you right. It's on me. That's why one of my main prayers—probably the one I say most often—is for wisdom on how to be a better father and husband. Because if you don't make it, it's not your failure. It's mine. I didn't prepare you properly. I didn't transfer the wisdom. I didn't build the bridge strong enough.
Not on my watch. Not with my kids. We're going to be part of that 3%, even if it kills me.
The Fifty-Dollar Mentor
In my early days running my own concrete business, I was still just an apprentice who thought I knew more than he did. Sure, I knew how to do the various tasks—bullfloat, fresno, walker. But the difference between an apprentice and a journeyman concrete finisher isn't knowing how to do things; it's knowing when.

So I would pay my Grandfather fifty dollars to sit on the tailgate and tell me what to do. (My Dad’s Idea) Picture it: me, a teenager full of energy and ambition, running around like my hair was on fire. And there's Grandpa, sitting on the tailgate with his ice chest full of beer and that smile that could light up a job site. One thing you could always count on in that ice chest was Yoohoo and Squirt. To this day, Squirt is still my favorite soda. He'd watch me work, take a sip, and call out: "Too wet, wait ten minutes" or "Hit it now before it sets up."
Fifty dollars for expertise that guaranteed success. Worth every penny. I can imagine how much he enjoyed those jobs—getting paid to drink beer and boss his grandson around? Living the dream. But for me, it was everything. My first real mentor. The bridge between knowing the moves and knowing the game.
Not every job went as smoothly as those, though. Being inexperienced, I'd often schedule too much work for too small a crew. I thought I was being ambitious, but really, I was being stupid. At one point, my dad's foreman—who I'd hire for side jobs—told me he wasn't going to work for me anymore. Just flat out: "I'm done."
Dad pulled me aside later, "If you're going to run jobs like this, Son, you've got to keep your men in mind. They're not machines. They're not you at eighteen with endless energy. Take care of your crew, or you won't have one."
That was the real lesson. Not just how to finish concrete, but how to build something bigger than a one-person show. How to think beyond my capacity. How to value the people who help you create. 
These days, remembering my grandpa on those tailgates—the patience, the wisdom he earned through decades of work, the joy he must have had passing it down. I think about sitting on my tailgate someday, ice chest beside me, watching one of you learn the difference between knowing how and knowing when.
The lessons from that tailgate stuck with me. But by the end of 2023, I was ready to apply them to something completely new.
The Excavator Foot Education
That's when I decided to build something revolutionary. You see, excavators turn like tanks—grinding, tearing, destroying everything underneath. The wear on the tracks, the stress on the machine, the damage to the ground. It's all so destructive. On pipeline jobs, they budget an entire line item just for repairing the asphalt after the excavators are done. Thousands of dollars in damage just from turning around. So, I'm out in my shop thinking, "What if the machine could just lift itself up and spin?"
It started with LEGO—you guys even helped me, they were your LEGOs! At first, I was just sitting at my kitchen table, building different configurations, testing the concept. Then I moved to wood and built a scale model in my shop. Once I confirmed that the physics worked, I graduated to steel. I managed to get an old forklift hydraulic cylinder from a jobsite, and I had some scrap metal out in the backyard, so I started fabricating the real thing.
Now, when you need to bend heavy steel and all you've got is an excavator, you get creative. I'd position the steel just right and use the bucket to bend it into shape. It worked great until one piece shot out like a missile and missed my head by about six inches. You know that moment when time slows down and you think, "Well, that's one way to explain things at the pearly gates—killed by my invention." But hey, that's innovation, right? Safety third, results first, explanations later.
I got the patent filed and sent the idea to Caterpillar. This thing will revolutionize how excavators move. We're talking potentially over a billion dollars of value over the 20-year life of the patent. Not bad for a guy who started with LEGO.
Yet, despite the potential and the excitement, who knew that what I was going to learn next would dwarf anything I had built before?
The Level Jump
I stumbled across this video from Myron Golden about the 4 Levels of Value Creation. He has an elegant way of describing it. In layperson's terms, Level 1 is trading muscle for money, Level 2 is managing other people's muscle, Level 3 is using your voice, and Level 4 is creating from pure imagination.
The excavator foot? That's pure Level 4 imagination. It's truly a revolutionary idea. But here's the kick in the teeth—I was executing it at Level 1. 
"By wisdom a house is built, and by understanding it is established; by knowledge the rooms are filled with all precious and pleasant riches." — Proverbs 24:3–4 
Every single unit required $1,500 or more in materials, and I was welding it together. Even if I sold them for $10,000 each, I'm still just a glorified manufacturer. Build one, sell one, build another until I die.
Now don't get me wrong—there's nothing wrong with building excavator attachments. I could make a lot of money doing it. Millions, even. It's just that there were higher levels of wealth creation I hadn't discovered yet. Not that I didn't know they existed—I'd seen software companies, franchises, all kinds of scalable businesses. I just didn't have the level of personal development to understand how to access them yet. Income does not far exceed personal development, remember? In short, I was trying to build Level 4 wealth with Level 1 thinking.
The VoiceQuote Revelation
Fast forward a bit, and I had begun reading Dan Martell's book. I didn't even know you could hire a mentor—like, literally pay someone successful to teach you their secrets. I immediately joined his elite coaching program. Worth every penny—and then some. I didn't even know what business I was going to build yet; I just knew he had the knowledge to get where I wanted to go. 
At this point, I was neck-deep in getting our franchise business up and running, busy learning the ropes of a completely different industry. But I could feel it in my bones—that itch to build something else, something bigger.
The first thing Dan taught me? I needed a brand. "Start posting on social media," he said. Easy for him to say! My first attempts were rough. One video was so bad I couldn't even post it. I'm serious— it was unwatchable levels of bad. Like watching a robot try to do stand-up comedy. I realized that to post content, I needed to know how to write, how to transfer the knowledge in my head to other people. So I took a writing course. Then another. Baby steps.
But something bigger was happening. I had learned something crucial: write down your goals. Not just think them, write them. When you can describe your future with the same level of detail as your present, you'll have a compelling future. I’ve always had goals and lists, but I had never focused intently on the details of how they would look when I got there. Where there is a clear vision, there is an acceleration towards a known goal. All I had to do now was figure out what my goal was. 
I wrote down a goal that seemed insane: $100 million net worth in 5 years. The math doesn’t work, but that's why I needed it. The goal is what creates the version of me that can accomplish it. See, I'd discovered something I call the Backwards Blueprint. You don't set goals by looking at where you are and projecting forward—that's just an inflation adjustment. You start at the impossible destination and work backwards.
Backwards blueprint
Year 5: $100M. What needs to exist? Multiple businesses generating $20M+ annually, scalable systems, a team running operations.
Year 4: What enables that? Businesses are already profitable, systems are documented, and leadership is in place.
Year 3: Products gaining traction, key hires made, revenue replacing construction income.
Year 2: MVP products in market, building audience, transitioning from builder to CEO mindset.
Year 1: Start building something scalable. Now.
 “Build once, sell forever”
At each level, I had to ask, "Who do I need to become?" The Kable who could generate $100M wasn't the guy in my garage thinking linearly—build one excavator foot, sell one, build another. $100M Kable thinks exponentially. Build once, sell forever. Every morning, I asked: "What would $100M Kable do today?" Not what felt comfortable. What would the version of me who'd already achieved this do right now? That question changed everything.
Coaching seemed like the obvious choice for my next business. But there are so many coaches out there, some way beyond my level. I was on a phone call with a coach who coaches people on how to become coaches—yeah, that's a lot of "coach" in one sentence. I was somewhat depressed. Imposter syndrome is real. That feeling that you’re not enough, and that people might find out. I'd always thought I needed to know everything before I could teach anything—that I needed to be some kind of guru. But you don't have to be a guru, you just have to be one step ahead.
The next day, still mulling over my conversation with the coach-who-coaches-coaches, I remembered and connected something. I've talked to programmers about app ideas multiple times over the years. I always wanted to create one. There was this one time I was discussing a possible app I called "Find It"—something that would search all the second-hand sites and aggregate results in one place. The app never worked out, but that's not the point. The developer looked at me and said, "You should create something in construction." At that moment, those were the worst words ever. Construction?! I was trying to get OUT of construction!
It had happened another time, too, with a different programmer. He had the same look in his eyes. And that morning, lying in bed connecting the dots, I finally realized what that look was: jealousy.
They knew I had something they could never have—an intimate knowledge of the painful workflows in a multi-billion dollar industry. An entire lifetime of connections, accounts, and direct knowledge of what doesn't work. They could code circles around me, but they'd never know which problems were worth solving.
That's when everything clicked. Software was the highest value lever yet. Build something once, and sell it forever. All the things I'd been learning—describing customer pain better than they can, niching down, making offers so good that people feel stupid saying no—they all pointed to this one idea.
And what I was going to do with it was going to change our family forever.
The Math That Changes Everything
Here's what thirty years in construction taught me that no MBA program ever could: contractors lose jobs every single day because they can't get quotes out fast enough. It's a classic story: the customer calls on Monday, you promise something by Wednesday, but then life happens, and suddenly it's Friday, and they've hired someone else. It's a billion-dollar problem hiding in plain sight.
So the saas (software as a service) VoiceQuote was born from that pain of experience. Instead of spending an hour at your kitchen table with a calculator and a legal pad after the kids go to bed, you just talk to your phone. Describe the job like you're explaining it to your foreman. The app turns your words into a professional quote in under a minute.
Building a business in an entirely new industry is tough. While the basics of business are always the same, raising money for a software startup feels a lot like trying to learn the rules to a mythical board game invented by someone who’s never actually played one.
There are rounds—Seed, Pre-Seed, Series A, B, C—and each one unlocks new powers (and new problems). Just like The Cones of Dunshire from Parks and Rec, the deeper you go, the more bizarre it gets: convertible notes that aren’t really debt, SAFEs that aren’t really safe, pre-money vs post-money valuations, and investor preferences that sound like they came from a wizard’s manual.
You're not just pitching your business—you’re rolling dice, navigating a map of legal terms, dilution traps, and mythical “strategic investors” who promise the world and then disappear after signing. One wrong move and you give away too much equity, lose control of your own company, or get trapped in a term sheet vortex designed by a Venture Capitalist who played the game twenty times before you ever opened the box.
It’s not that it’s impossible—it’s just that nobody gives you the rulebook. And by the time you’ve figured it out, the board has changed. 
I am still learning this one, but my gut tells me I would rather own 100% of a smaller company than a fraction of a bigger one. It feels like the rules were written by the investors, leaving the builders what’s left. Instead of playing their game, we're bootstrapping with revenue from our other businesses. Slower? Maybe. But I own 100% of the decisions.
 Life’s too short not to build something with your friends, and I hope it turns into a great time. I have two friends who are working on it with me. You have to be careful partnering with friends, but don’t be afraid of it.
Here's where the math gets interesting. With the excavator foot, let’s say I sell one for $10k, spend $5k making it, pocket $5k, then start welding another one. It's good money, but I'm still trading my time for money. With saas? I build it once for maybe $100k, then sell subscriptions at $50 a month to thousands of contractors forever.
The excavator foot makes money when I'm working. VoiceQuote makes money when I'm sleeping. Or fishing. Or sitting on a tailgate with a beer like Grandpa used to.
Dan Martell has this phrase: "This s**t prints money." It sounds crass, but he's right. Not because it's magic—because you build it once and sell it forever. Because it scales without you. Because ten thousand contractors can use it at the same time, and you don't have to build ten thousand of anything.
See, the excavator foot solves a mechanical problem. It helps operators work more efficiently. That's valuable, sure. But VoiceQuote? It solves a human problem. It gives contractors their evenings back. It saves marriages. It lets dads make it to their kids' games.
Spend your energy solving big problems, not worrying about small ones. Don't get sucked into yelling at the driver who cut you off or into complaining about how long the line is. Be excited that there's traffic—that's more time to improve yourself, to listen to a book or a podcast, to reflect on things. Every annoyance is an opportunity if you're building bigger than yourself.
That's what building bigger than yourself means. It's not simply solving problems, but solving the issues behind the problems. Not just making money, but making time. Not just building products, but building possibilities for how people can live.
The Empire Blueprint
So here's how the math works when you start thinking bigger than yourself. We've got Record Construction, which is established and stable—the foundation my Dad built that we've maintained. Then there's Record Homes, where we develop land for manufactured homes and continue to grow every year. It's a cash business with no debt and we own one hundred percent of the process.
But that's just the beginning. As I mentioned before, we bought the rights to 10 Playa Bowls locations in the West Valley. Yeah, acai bowls might seem like a left turn from concrete, but recurring revenue from food service? That's the kind of diversification that builds empires. Plus, every one of you kids will get a shot at running your own location if you want it. Any and all of you can learn the business from the ground up.
Then there's VoiceQuote, which could dwarf everything else. Software scales infinitely. Whether you have one customer or ten thousand, the cost is essentially the same. (I know that’s a simplification, but you get my point) That's the kind of math that changes everything.
And I'm not done. There's room for more ventures, more opportunities, more ways to build.
Eight kids. Five major business lines. Suddenly, everyone's not fighting for a piece—they're finding their place. Some of you might be operations people who love the day-to-day. Others might be innovators who see what's next. Some will be people managers. Some will be systems builders.
Here's one thing I’ve discovered being a father: I'm the only person on this planet who genuinely wants you to do better than I did. Not just make more money—though I wish that for you too. I want you to have more balance, more joy, more impact. I want you to learn from my twenty years of building without a bigger vision—good years, productive years, but years that could have compounded into so much more. You can start at 20 with what took me until 40 to figure out.
That's what building bigger than yourself means. It's not about equal division of assets. It's about the multiplication of opportunities. It's about creating a foundation so solid that each of you can build your empire on top of it.
“The goal isn't to raise rich kids—it's to raise capable adults who happen to have opportunities”
But creating opportunities isn't enough if I don't prepare you to handle them, because there's a pattern I've seen too many times to ignore.
What Takes One Generation to Build...
"What takes one generation to build takes one to lose." I've watched it happen: successful contractors whose kids can't swing a hammer, entrepreneurs whose legacy becomes a museum instead of a machine.
The goal isn't to raise rich kids—it's to raise capable adults who happen to have opportunities. That's why I'm documenting these principles, why you work with me, and why we talk about equity versus income. Not to repeat my path, but to understand the principles behind it.
Because when you give your kids the fruit but never teach them how to farm, they inherit wealth but not wisdom. They get assets but not the ability to create more. What are you building that outlasts you?
A job ends the day you stop showing up. A bank account gets divided and spent. Even a successful business can die if the next generation or new owners fail to understand its soul. But principles? Systems? Character? The ability to identify and solve painful problems? These compound across generations.
Find the problem that pisses you off enough to solve it permanently. Build the solution. Then—and this is the key—build it bigger than you could ever use yourself. Build it so it works without you. Build it so others can build on top of it.
“What takes one generation to build takes one to lose.”
Building bigger than yourself doesn't necessarily mean constructing bigger buildings. It means building bigger builders. It means creating foundations so solid that the fourth generation doesn't just survive—they thrive.
The question I wrestle with: How do you transfer all of this? How do you pass on not just the businesses, but the ability to build businesses? Not just the wealth, but the wisdom to create more? That question keeps me up at night. Because I can build all the companies in the world, with all the assets and success, but if I can't transfer the builder's mindset to you... Then I've failed at the only job that actually matters. Maybe that's precisely the problem—trying to transfer from a position of strength instead of showing you the falls that built the strength.
The Thanksgiving Table Crash
Maybe the best way to show you how falling builds character is to tell you about the time I fell at your mom's grandparents' Thanksgiving table. The night before, I was nervous about making a good impression and couldn’t sleep. It was more likely due to a bad diet and poor sleep habits, but I'd taken Tylenol PM to help. In my twenty-year-old wisdom, I figured being well-rested was better than being alert, although I doubt I thought it that far through.
Sitting at the dinner table, surrounded by her entire family, trying to project casual confidence, I was leaning back in my chair on two legs like I owned the place. My girlfriend—now wife—must have thought I looked too comfortable. She reached over to nudge my chair, expecting me to grab the table, and we'd all laugh. You know, in the movie Inception, where they are supposed to feel the “kick”? Not me. I felt nothing. No reflexes. The Tylenol PM fog hadn't lifted. No instinct to catch myself. Just... timber. I went down like a redwood, slow enough to know it was happening, too drugged to stop it. The crash silenced twenty conversations. Every aunt, uncle, and cousin turned to stare at the boyfriend who'd just literally fallen for their relative.
I scrambled up, righted the chair, and mumbled something about being fine. Tried to pretend it hadn't happened. But Grandpa—80 years old with no filter—wasn't having it. "Hey, Kable," he called from across the table, "you and me have something in common." Finally, someone breaking the silence. Maybe a bonding moment?
"We both hate cats," he announced in a booming voice, then paused for effect, "but we love..." Let's just say he used another word for cats. The kind that makes an entire table of family members suddenly find their mashed potatoes fascinating.
"Oh, he's turning red!" Grandma helpfully announced, providing color commentary for my humiliation. And I was. Face burning, ears on fire, probably glowing like a Christmas bulb. Expectant faces trying not to laugh. Your mom's hand finding mine under the table—I couldn't tell if she was mortified or trying not to lose it herself. The silence stretched on, broken only by the sound of forks awkwardly moving food around plates while everyone waited to see if I'd spontaneously combust or somehow make this worse.
Somehow, the dinner continued despite me and the awkward comparison story by Grandpa. The rest of the day is a blur now. There was no way other than up from there. No matter what you do, there are going to be moments when people see exactly who you are, flaws and all, and decide to move forward together anyway. 
King David's Final Project
King David spent his final years gathering materials for a temple he'd never see built. "You will not build a house for my Name," God told him, "because you are a warrior and have shed blood."
So David became the preparer instead of the builder. He could have been bitter—all that vision, all that passion, and he didn't even get to lay the cornerstone. Instead, he celebrated: "My son Solomon is young and inexperienced, and the house to be built for the Lord should be of great magnificence."
He stockpiled gold, silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone. He organized the workers. He drew up the plans. He even arranged the worship teams. Everything Solomon would need, David provided in advance.
That's what building bigger than yourself looks like. David built by preparing another builder. His legacy wasn't in laying stones—it was in ensuring stones would be laid after he was gone. "I have taken great pains to provide for the temple," he said. Great pains. For something he'd never see.
Sometimes your greatest build is preparing the next builder to build greater than you ever could.

Big Dreams Are Inspiring—But Are You Living Them?
  Record Construction will pay the bills. Record Homes will continue to grow. Playa Bowls will diversify us. The excavator foot might make me rich. VoiceQuote might make me wealthy. But here's what building all these businesses has taught me: You can build an empire and still be building on sand if you're not living the principles that got you there.
I've spent years collecting these foundations—identity, character, systems, connection. I've built businesses on them, written this book about them. But there's a gap between knowing these lessons and embodying them every single day.
What if I hand you all these insights, but you see me living something different? What if I preach identity but live in fear? What if I teach systems but operate in chaos? What if I write about connection, but you watch me choose efficiency over family?
The next generation doesn't just need these principles written down. They need to see them lived out. Not perfectly—but consistently. Not just when it's convenient—but especially when it costs something.
Want to know what it looks like when someone who's built everything finally realizes they need to become what they've been teaching?
Then let me tell you about the kid who showed up to a minimum wage job dressed for his destiny... 

The Truth in 5 Minutes
Most people build pyramids they don't transfer—then wonder why their legacy dies with them.
Only 3% of family businesses make it to the fourth generation. Not because the money runs out, but because the builder's mindset doesn't transfer. We pass down assets instead of abilities, wealth instead of wisdom, businesses instead of the builder's spirit.
Think about it—if I hand you VoiceQuote but you don't know how to innovate, how long before a competitor crushes you? If I give you Record Construction but you can't solve new problems, how long before it fails? Every skill I don't transfer, every system I don't document, every person I don't develop—that's potential dying with me.
Your highest value isn't what you build—it's who you build.
The excavator foot could make me rich, but I'm still welding each one myself. That's Level 1 thinking with a Level 4 idea. VoiceQuote? Built once, sold forever. That's building bigger than myself. One creates a job that dies with me. The other creates value that multiplies without me.
Your 5-Minute Action Plan:
	•	Name your dependency (2 min): What are you creating that requires your constant presence? If you disappeared tomorrow, what would collapse within a month?
	•	Find your hoarding (2 min): What knowledge lives only in your head? Who are you NOT developing because it's easier to do it yourself?
	•	Act before you sleep (1 min): Choose one thing to transfer this week. A skill to teach. A system to document. A person to develop. Write the first step.
Eight kids. Multiple businesses. I could divide everything equally and watch it disappear in a generation. Or I can build builders. Create systems that multiply. Solve problems so completely that the solution outlives the solver. Because empires aren't built by one person working harder—they're built by creating other builders.
The Builder's Formula at Work: IDENTITY + ACTION Building bigger requires Identity (I am a legacy builder, not just a wealth creator) and immediate Action (starting transfers before you see results).
Before You Move On: Start one transfer this week. Not next month when you're "ready"—this week while you're still building. Teach someone a skill you've been hoarding. Document a system only you understand. That's how empires are built—one builder at a time.







Chapter 8: 
From Knowing to Being 

"The execution of my duties will be swift and efficient, guided by the very principles in this creed that I have sworn to uphold. I will train like I fight."
—From The Builder's Creed
The kid showed up to his Playa Bowls interview in a full suit and tie. Applying for a minimum wage job making acai bowls, and he's dressed like he's meeting Warren Buffett.
My manager hired him on the spot. We knew immediately—this kid was going places. Not because of the suit, but because he understood something most people know but don't live: You dress for the job you want, not the one you have.
It's such a simple principle. Everyone's heard it. Your grandmother probably told you. But how many actually do it? How many show up to life dressed for where they're going instead of where they are?
That kid already knows something that took me until 40 to act on. But here's what nobody tells you about that moment of knowing - it's not a moment. It's a gap. A messy, uncomfortable space between who you were and who you're becoming.
That gap never goes away. We are always there. We keep moving the goal because being in the gap is what causes growth.
I'm writing this chapter from inside that gap.
Living in the Gap
Six weeks before starting this book, I joined Dan Martell's coaching program. I have read countless books on self-improvement and business, but it’s called elite business coaching for a reason. I quickly realized I needed to write, to post on social media (something I swore I'd never do), to build software instead of just foundations. My identity shifted overnight. But my reality? That takes longer to catch up.

I know I'm building toward $100M. I know VoiceQuote will transform an industry. I know our Playa Bowls locations will create generational opportunities. But right now? I'm a concrete guy who just opened his first acai bowl shop. The mindset has shifted. The results are still arriving.
Our first Playa Bowls location had the biggest grand opening in the state so far. The line stretched around the building. Standing there watching the crowd, I felt it - that weird space between who I've been for 40 years and who I'm becoming.
Success is relative. To the guy pushing carts at Walmart, I'm living the dream - multiple businesses, lovely house, building generational wealth. To Alex Hormozi, I'm just getting started. And you know what? Both are right.
That's what nobody tells you about growth - you're always in the middle. Always successful to someone behind you, always beginning compared to someone ahead. The gap between knowing and living these principles isn't a one-time crossing. It's a perpetual state.
The Wrong kind of moving up
Growing up as a concrete contractor, I thought the General Contractor had it made. They were the guy at the top. The main dude. They made all the money, just walked around and talked, drove the fancy truck.
So when the recession hit in 2008, I had to accept every job to feed you kids and try to save our house. I would bid a job and they would ask if I could do pavers, or build a bathroom, or whatever “thing” the job entailed. I would look them in the eye and say, “Yes, I can.” Now this was kind of a grey area. I had not actually done those things before, but I knew I could do it. As a result, we gained the skills necessary to obtain our general contractor's license. Finally, I'd be the guy at the top.
Fast forward to this remodel job. The lady had a brain tumor, and her husband divorced her because of it. Awful, right? The only detail she really cared about in her crumbling world was the baseboards. She wanted stain-grade oak baseboards, stained and sealed.
I hired a big company to ensure quality work. Two guys showed up in a Chevy S-10, one saw, and a bunch of baseboards hanging off a rack on top. These two yahoos were supposed to install premium stain-grade oak baseboards?
Fast forward to a month later, and I'm standing there with the homeowner and the owner of the baseboard company, finally admitting it was the worst baseboard job he'd ever seen. The rest of the house was flawless, but this one detail—the only one that mattered to her—was destroyed.
I realized the GC has all the liability but none of the control. He has to get other people to do the work and hope there's enough money left over to make a profit. I could control the quality of my concrete jobs with my own hands. As a GC, I was helpless, or at least entirely dependent on someone else.
We made way more money doing concrete, where I had complete control. But it took becoming a GC to understand that moving up levels isn't always moving up in life.
Building on the Right Foundation
Jesus told this story about two builders. Both heard the same teachings. Both had the same knowledge. Both built houses. The only difference? One built on rock, one built on sand.
Then the storm came.
The house on the rock stood firm. The house on the sand? Complete destruction. "Great was its fall," Jesus said. Not just minor damage—total collapse.
Both builders thought they were building something solid until the storm revealed their foundation. The foolish builder probably admired his house every day, maybe even bragged about how quickly he'd built it. The sand felt firm enough in dry weather.
That's what these principles are—your foundation. Not magic words that change everything overnight. Bedrock that keeps you standing when the storms hit. And storms always hit.
The difference between knowing truths and living them is the difference between sand and rock. One feels stable until pressure comes. The other IS stable when pressure comes.
Happy But Not Satisfied
Right now, I own construction companies, land, franchises. To some of you reading this, that sounds like 'making it.' But I'm writing this at 4 AM because I know I'm meant to build bigger. Not because what I have isn't enough - I'm grateful every day. But because growth is who we are. Builders build. Always.
I'm not better than the cart pusher. I've just already pushed my carts. We're all at different stages of the same journey. There's nothing wrong with being at any stage. The problem arises when you're at a stage of complaining about it without taking action to change it. Or worse - when you achieve a little success and decide you're done growing. Happy but not satisfied. Grateful but still hungry. Content with what I have, but not with who I am yet. Some people call this a contradiction. I call it being a builder.
Some of the happiest people I know have the least stuff. They've found contentment. But the most ALIVE people I know? They're the ones who are grateful for today while building tomorrow. They don't need more to be happy. They build more because building is who they are.
The Morning Declaration
Living these principles requires daily practice, not just one-time decisions. That's why, before I read the Builder's Creed each morning, I start with something equally important but different. The Creed tells me who I am as a builder and warrior. But these words? They acknowledge where I am while declaring where I'm going:
I am grateful for where I am today, but I am not done yet. I am driven to improve. I am committed to creating. I am hungry to learn. I am called to share what I've been given. I am determined to grow. God loves me and directs my steps. Every day, I get better. Every day, I move closer to my vision. Every day, I build the life and legacy I was born to create.
“I am grateful for where I am today, but I am not done yet.”
The power is in the present tense. "I am grateful." "I am driven." "I am committed." Not "I will be" or "I want to be." I AM. Because as we learned in Chapter 1, you are what you say you are—especially in those early morning hours when it's just you and what you know is right.
"I am grateful for where I am today, but I am not done yet." That single line contains everything—acknowledgment without complacency, contentment without settling. It's the difference between that kid who knows he's starting at minimum wage AND knows he's going somewhere bigger.
You can't fake this. Your kids, your team, your customers—they know if you're just mouthing words or living them. The declaration only works when it's written in your actions, not just your journal.
Your Stage, Your Choice
Your 'suit moment' will be different than mine. Maybe it's:
	•	Going from employee to business owner
	•	From one truck to a fleet
	•	From local to national
From thousands to millions 
The principles don't change. The struggle doesn't change. You just struggle with bigger things.
We're all in the gap between who we were yesterday and who we're becoming tomorrow. The only difference? Some people know they're in the gap and keep moving. Others think they've arrived and stop growing. Guess which ones end up in the 3% and last four generations?
The Daily Choice
Every morning, I read my declarations. Every day, I make decisions as $100M Kable, not concrete guy Kable. Some days I feel like a fraud.  Because that's what that kid shows us - you dress for where you're going, not where you are, even when you are standing in an acai bowl shop you never imagined owning, wondering how a concrete guy ended up there.
That's what living these principles looks like. Not a magical transformation. Not walking on water the moment you decide you can. But daily choosing to act like the person you've decided to be, even when your reality hasn't caught up yet.
The skills you have and acquire are all that are truly yours. And the skill of becoming who you've decided to be---of closing the gap between knowing and living---that's the skill that multiplies all your other skills.
So here's your assignment: Where are you still acting like your old self instead of who you want to become? Maybe it's how you dress. Perhaps it's how you think. Maybe it's what you say about yourself. Where's the gap between who you decided to be and how you're showing up? The idea is to help you identify where you're not living what you know.
Because knowing these principles is just the beginning, living them — that's where the fundamental transformation happens. And it happens one day at a time, one decision at a time, one declaration at a time.
Even when your reality hasn't caught up to who you've decided to be.
It will. But only if you keep dressing for where you're going.

Living The Principles Is Hard—Transferring Them Is Harder
Every morning, I read both declarations. Every day, I work to embody them. But lately, I've been asking myself a more complicated question: Can I transfer this?
Not just the words, but the practice? Not just the principles, but the ability to discover new ones?
All these lessons I've learned—some at 10, some at 25, some at 40—they only matter if they transfer. Not just as words on a page. Not just as stories you've heard, but as a living capability to build your pyramids, discover your insights, and fight your own battles.
I watch you kids work with me. You're learning systems, not just sweat. You see me choose building over comfort. You watch me fail and adjust. But are you catching the deeper thing? Are you learning how to learn? Are you building the muscle to discover your insights when I'm not here to point them out?
Only 3% of family businesses make it to the fourth generation. That is a crazy statistic. Not because of the money—money can be rebuilt. Because it means 97% of the time, the builder's mindset doesn't transfer. The ability to live and discover what matters dies with the one who found them.
Want to know what it takes to transfer capability, not just capital? To pass on the ability to build, not just what's been built?
Then let me show you why 97% of families are transferring the wrong thing entirely...
The Truth in 5 Minutes
People spend decades knowing what to do in the gap, but not living it.
That kid in the suit? He's already living what took me until 40 to live out. The GC license I thought would change everything? Just another title without transformation. The real change came when I stopped collecting wisdom and started living it.
Here's the truth that changes everything: Living beats knowing. Always.
The kid who shows up in a suit beats the expert who talks about success. The person who lives one lesson surpasses the guru teaching ten. Because principles only transform when they move from your head to your hands.
Right now, you're standing in that same gap. You know things you're not living. Every morning, you're either that kid in the suit or another year older, still wearing yesterday's identity.
Your 5-Minute Action Plan:
	•	Name your gap (2 min): Where are you dressed for the job you have, not the one you want? What principle do you quote but not live?
	•	Choose your embodiment (2 min): What ONE thing will you do differently TODAY that proves you're becoming, not just knowing?
	•	Act before you sleep (1 min): Write down your commitment. Set a phone alarm. Do it before your head hits the pillow tonight.
Only 3% of family businesses make it to the fourth generation because 97% transfer knowledge without transferring the ability to live it. The next generation doesn't need your knowledge. They need your example.
Before You Move On: Tonight, do that one thing you wrote down. Not tomorrow. Tonight. Because Chapter 9 is about transfer, and you can't transfer what you haven't embodied.
The Builder’s Formula at Work:  Moving from KNOWING to BEING  That kid in the suit understood something I didn't at that age – The Builder’s Formula must move from your head to your hands. Living beats knowing.
Before You Move On
Tonight, before you sleep, do that one thing you wrote down. Not tomorrow. Tonight. Because Chapter 9 is about transfer, and you can't transfer what you haven't embodied. The knowing-living gap doesn't close itself. You close it, one lived principle at a time.






Chapter 9:
The Transfer
"The ability to control my emotions and my actions, regardless of circumstance, sets me apart. I ask not for Divine providence or more riches but more wisdom by which to accept and use wisely the riches I received at birth in the form of the power to control and direct my mind to whatever ends I desire."
—From The Builder's Creed
I've spent years thinking about this question: Why do the Israelites seem to forget everything their fathers learned in just one generation? Even Solomon, the wisest person who ever lived, failed to transfer the kingdom successfully. He was a second-generation king, and his son Rehoboam split the kingdom in two. Part of that was Solomon's mistakes—taking his eyes off what mattered, not keeping his own house in order.
That's the thing about transfer: You can't give what you don't have. You can't transfer strength from weakness. Like the stewardess tells you on the airplane—put your mask on first. If your house isn't in order, how can you help someone else build theirs?
Why 97% Transfer the Wrong Thing
Every successful person I know is obsessed with making sure their kids don't lose what they've built. So we create trusts and draft wills. Build tax strategies. Set up foundations. We spend fortunes on estate planning to transfer our estates.
But we're transferring the wrong thing.
Think about it: If I hand you a successful business but you don't know how to run it, how long before it fails? If I give you wealth but you don't understand how to create it, how long before it's gone? If I leave you a mansion but you don't know how to maintain it, how long before it falls apart?
Transferring the wrong things is why family businesses fail. Not because the transfer mechanisms fail. Even perfect mechanisms can't fix the problem of transferring the wrong things. It's like having the world's best delivery system to ship empty boxes.
We transfer assets instead of abilities. We transfer wealth instead of wisdom. We transfer businesses instead of the builder's mindset. We transfer the pyramid instead of the blueprint.
Yes, the statistics I'm about to share focus on family businesses. But swap 'business' for any meaningful legacy—athletic excellence, artistic mastery, spiritual depth, intellectual rigor—and the 97% failure rate holds. Most legacies die in transfer because we hand down the results instead of the recipe.
The Math of Business Survival
Let me paint you a picture with real numbers:
Every year in the US, about 5 million new businesses are started. Within one year, 20% are gone. By year five, only 50% remain. By year ten, 70% have failed.
So out of 5 million businesses:
	•	Year 1: 4 million survive (80%)
	•	Year 5: 2.5 million survive (50%)
	•	Year 10: 1.75 million survive (35%)
Now add generational transfer:
	•	Making it to Generation 2: 525,000 (30% of survivors)
	•	Making it to Generation 3: 68,000 (13% of Gen 2)
	•	Making it to Generation 4: 2,048 (3% of Gen 3)
That's 2,000 out of 5 million. 0.04% of the original businesses make it to the fourth generation
Brutal odds. But that’s what makes generational legacy so rare — and so valuable.
Here’s the kicker—that's just businesses that survive each generation. The ones that thrive and grow? That transfer not just the business but the ability to build businesses? We're talking about a fraction of that percentage.
This isn't just about fourth-generation businesses. We're all part of someone's four-generation story. Every transfer faces these same odds. Every handoff is a chance for everything to fall apart.
How Wealth Really Dies
Here's the pattern I've watched play out:
Generation 1 (The Builder): Starts with nothing. Learns through struggle. Builds from identity up. Creates wealth through wisdom. Your great-grandfather with his pickaxe, turning dirt into dollars.
Generation 2 (The Maintainer): Watches the builder. Learns the business. Maintains what exists. Grows through systems. Your grandfather took that foundation and built Record Construction.
Generation 3 (The Expander): That's me. We inherited an existing structure and managed to grow it. Added Record Homes, diversified, and expanded. We're the ones who either multiply or squander what we've been given.
Generation 4 (The Question Mark): That's you. And that question mark motivates me. Because by the numbers, this is where it usually dies.
The pattern is so predictable it's painful. The failure doesn't happen in Generation 4. It occurs in Generation 1, 2, or 3 when we focus on transferring the wrong thing.
The Penthouse Problem
Remember the pyramid we've been building throughout this book?
     
Most successful people try to build their entire pyramid, then hand it to their kids from the top down. Here's the legacy I built. Here's the scale we've achieved. Here are the connections I've made.
But you can't receive a pyramid from the top down. You can't install LEGACY without IDENTITY. You can't maintain SCALE without STRUGGLE. You can't inherit CONNECTION without CHARACTER.
It's like trying to live on the eighth floor of a building with no foundation. It doesn't matter how beautiful that penthouse is—without the floors beneath it, it's just going to crash.
Asset Transfer vs. Capability Transfer
Through seeing families and businesses succeed and fail, I've discovered there are only three ways wealth transfers between generations:
Type 1: Asset Transfer - Just Stuff. Parents transfer money, businesses, and properties. Children receive without earning. No struggle means no strength. These families might look successful for a while, but their success is built on sand. The money runs out, the business fails, and the properties get sold.
Type 2: Opportunity Transfer - Work Without Wisdom. Parents create opportunities for children to work in the business. This is better—there's some struggle, some learning. But without the complete blueprint, without understanding the why behind the what, it's just following someone else's path. You might maintain what exists, but can you build something new?
Type 3: Capability Transfer - The Full Blueprint. This is different. It's not just working in the business or getting handed the keys. It's understanding how to build businesses. It's having both the opportunity AND the wisdom behind it. It's this book plus the work. It's knowing my struggles so you don't repeat them, then building your pyramid higher than mine.
I'm trying to do Type 3 with you. Yes, you work in the business (Type 2), but this book—these principles—this is me trying to transfer the blueprint, not just the building.
Most parents default to Type 1 because it feels like love. Creating struggle feels like cruelty. But let me ask you something: Which is crueler—letting you struggle while I'm here to guide you, or letting you fail when I'm gone?
The Mantle That Had to Fall
Elisha wouldn't leave Elijah's side. Three times Elijah tried to go alone to Bethel, Jericho, and the Jordan. Three times Elisha refused: "As surely as the Lord lives and as you live, I will not leave you."
Other prophets kept telling Elisha, "Do you know the Lord is going to take your master today?" 
"Yes, I know," Elisha replied. "So be quiet."
When the chariot of fire finally came for Elijah, his mantle fell to the ground. Elisha didn't hesitate—he tore his clothes in two and picked up Elijah's cloak. You can't wear two mantles. Had to fully let go of who he'd been to become who he was called to be.
Elisha asked for a "double portion" of Elijah's spirit. Not his assets. Not his position. His spirit. His capability. And he got it—the Bible records twice as many miracles through Elisha as through Elijah.
That's a real transfer. Not the mantle falling, but the spirit multiplying. Not maintaining what was, but building something greater.
Truth About Love
The greatest act of love isn't making life easy for you. It's making you capable of handling life when it's hard.
Every time I solve your problem, I steal your strength. Every time I remove your struggle, I remove your growth. Every time I hand you results, I rob you of capability.
This isn't about being harsh. It's about being helpful. Not helpful for today—helpful for twenty years from now when you're facing your own El Paso moment and I'm not there to fix it.
 “Every time I solve your problem, I steal your strength.”
I watch other successful fathers hand their kids everything, then wonder why those kids can't handle anything. They've stolen their children's struggles—and with them, their strength.
The Fourth Generation Formula
So here it is—the pyramid transfer formula for generational success:
1. Build your pyramid completely. Every layer, bottom to top. No shortcuts. I'm still building mine.
2. Document the blueprint. Not just what you built, but how and why. The struggles that taught you. The failures that shaped you. The principles you discovered. (That's what this book is.)
3. Transfer capability, not assets. I'll help you build your pyramids while I'm here to guide the process.
4. Create productive struggle. Not pointless suffering, but challenges with purpose and endpoints that build specific strengths.
5. Teach bigger building. Your pyramid should dwarf mine, just as mine should dwarf your grandfather's.
6. Make building the legacy. Not having, not owning, not inheriting. Building.
What I'm Trying to Give You
Look, the whole point of this book is so you don't have to repeat my struggles. I already dug the canal, survived El Paso, and lost the house. You don't need to relive those exact battles. That would be like making you start with a pickaxe when we now have excavators.
What I'm trying to transfer is the ability to recognize and handle YOUR struggles when they come. Because they will come—just different ones. Bigger ones. The kind that comes with building something larger than what I've built.
You need to know who you are at your core. That identity work? Non-negotiable. Everything builds from there.
You need to understand why our systems work, not just follow them mindlessly. When something breaks—and it will—you need to know how to think about fixing it, not just call me.
Watch how I build relationships. The real work happens in the follow-through, the integrity when it costs something, the long-term thinking when everyone else is chasing quick wins.
I tell you about every failure not so you avoid failure, but so you know how to extract value from it. El Paso wasn't a disaster—it was painful education. The house we lost wasn't a failure—it was tuition for a degree in resilience.
Start whatever you're building with a massive vision. Your first venture might be small, but think about it as if it could become an empire. Install those thinking patterns early: How would this scale? What systems would break? Where's the real value? 
Most importantly, understand this: We're builders. Not maintainers. Not inheritors. Builders. And builders build new things, not just maintain old ones.

Transfer Is Critical—But Without These Three Things, It All Falls Apart
Your assignment isn't to finish reading—it's to start transferring. This week, begin one real transfer. Not money, not assets, not even opportunities. Transfer the ability to create those things. Guide someone through their El Paso. Let them dig their canal while you sit on the tailgate. Build builders.
Because in the end, what matters isn't what you build. It's who you build. And that building starts with the very next conversation you have.
You can inherit all my businesses, all my systems, all my connections. But if you can't inherit the ability to live and discover principles for yourself—if all you get are my answers instead of your own questions—then I've failed you.
Stories are powerful. They teach and shape us. But stories without action are just entertainment.
I've given you nine chapters of lessons learned in holes at 2 AM, principles discovered through decades of building. But if all you do is nod along and think "that's interesting," then I've failed you.
You need to move. Now. Today. Before the inspiration fades and life's urgencies crowd out what's important.
So I've distilled everything—every story, every principle, every hard-won lesson—into the Builder’s Formula.
The Builder’s Formula, when lived and followed together, makes failure impossible and success inevitable.
The builders who changed the world all discovered these same three: different words, different times, same unstoppable force.
Want to know what they are?

The Truth in 5 Minutes
97% of families transfer the wrong thing entirely—and wonder why their legacy dies in one generation.
Look at the pattern: Generation 1 builds from nothing. Generation 2 maintains what exists. Generation 3 might expand it. Generation 4? Gone. Why? Because we transfer assets instead of abilities, wealth instead of wisdom, businesses instead of the builder's mindset. We hand our kids fish while jealously guarding the fishing rod.
“You can't transfer a pyramid—only the ability to build one.”
I watch successful parents shield their kids from every struggle, then wonder why those kids can't handle anything. They've stolen their children's strength in the name of love. Every problem you solve for them is a capability they'll never develop. Every obstacle you remove is a muscle that never forms.
Love means letting them struggle while you're here to guide.
The cruelest thing you can do is make their life easy now, ensuring it falls apart when you're gone. You can't transfer a pyramid—only the ability to build one. The transfer that matters doesn't happen through wills or trusts. It happens through working alongside, failing together, building in parallel. Through letting them see you still learning, still struggling, still becoming.
Your 5-Minute Action Plan:
	•	Name your transfer failure (2 min): Are you passing on assets or abilities? What capability dies if you disappear tomorrow? Where are you creating dependence instead of strength?
	•	Find your opportunity (2 min): Who needs what you've learned (not what you've earned)? What struggle could you guide instead of solve? Which wisdom is dying with you?
	•	Act before you sleep (1 min): Choose one capability to transfer this week. One person to develop. One struggle to guide, not remove. Write the specific action.
The transfer happens in the messy middle, not at some imaginary finish line. Stop waiting to be "ready" to teach. Your imperfect knowledge transferred beats your perfect knowledge hoarded.
The Builder's Formula at Work: TRANSFERRING THE TOOLS You can't transfer what you haven't mastered. This chapter shows how to pass on all three principles, not just their results.
Before You Move On: Start one real transfer this week. Guide someone through their El Paso. Let them dig their canal while you sit on the tailgate. Build builders, not pyramids.
You can transfer all the individual principles, but if you don't understand how they work together, you're still missing the formula that makes success inevitable. Want to know what ties it all together? Then let’s talk about the three-part formula that changes everything...







Chapter 10: 
The Builder’s Formula: What Makes Success Inevitable
"I expect results. While these expectations will appear to be unrealistic to those who have not committed to excellence, results are the only acceptable outcome."
—From The Builder's Creed
Stories are powerful. They shape us, teach us, remind us who we are. But stories without action are just entertainment, and that's not why I wrote this book.
You've now seen these three principles in every story:
IDENTITY drove me to declare "We are finishers" at 2 AM
ACTION pushed me to build with LEGOs before CAD drawings
PERSISTENCE kept me going through El Paso, failed businesses, and personal transformation
The goal is to develop each of these principles as much as possible—making each circle bigger. The larger each circle grows, the more they overlap in the center. That overlap is where success lives. The Builder’s Formula isn’t just another framework—it’s THE framework. Master it, and everything else becomes inevitable.

“If your mindset is right and you start the thing, and you never stop pushing forward, there's nothing that can stop you from achieving your goals.”
The Builder’s formula explained
1. Decide Who You Are and Be That Person Now
Not who you were yesterday or who you hope to become someday. Choose your identity and live from it immediately. "I am successful." "I am a builder." "I am someone who finishes what I start." The future version of you isn't waiting somewhere down the road—that person exists the moment you decide they do.
2. Start Before You're Ready
The distance between idea and execution is measured in speed, not quality. Build ugly first versions while others perfect their logos. Every day you wait is a day someone else gets ahead. The market rewards action, not intention.
3. Never Stop Moving Forward
Not fast forward—just forward. Some days you'll sprint, some days you'll crawl, some days you'll get knocked flat. But you get up and take the next step. Winners aren't people who never fall. They're people who refuse to stay down.
That's it. Everything else—the systems, the connections, the character building, the scaling—all of that flows from these three foundations.
You don't need perfect conditions. You don't need more time, more money, or more knowledge. You need identity, action, and persistence. The world belongs to builders. And builders build—even when they don't feel like it, even when the math doesn't work, even when everyone says it's impossible.
Your great-grandfather started with a pickaxe and an unshakeable belief that he could turn dirt into dollars. You have tools he couldn't imagine and knowledge he'd have killed for. (Haha, that saying sounds intense when you write it down… He wasn’t a killer, just a hard worker.) 
Let me show you what these three principles look like when lived at the highest level. I've gathered nine of history's greatest builders to share what I imagine their stories would sound like. Listen carefully—not for inspiration, but for instruction.
Principle 1 in action: Decide Who You Are and Be That Person Now
Muhammad Ali understood identity. He screamed, “I am the greatest!” for everyone to hear:
"March 1964. Miami Beach Convention Hall. They're calling me Cassius Clay, but that's not who I am anymore. I'm Muhammad Ali, and tonight I'm fighting Sonny Liston—the most feared man in boxing."
"The crowd's against me. 8-to-1 odds. The older writers think I'm a clown, a loudmouth kid about to get destroyed. But I've already won this fight. Won it the moment I looked in the mirror this morning and said what I've been saying for months: 'I am the greatest.'"
"Not 'I will be great.' Not 'I hope to win.' I AM the greatest."
"Round four, something's burning in my eyes. Can barely see. My corner wants to cut the gloves off. But then I hear my voice from this morning: 'I am the greatest.' And the greatest doesn't quit because his eyes burn."
"By round six, Liston's done. The most feared man in boxing quits on his stool. And I'm on the ropes screaming, 'I am the greatest!' But here's what they don't understand—I didn't become the greatest by beating Liston. I beat Liston because I was already the greatest. I’ve been the greatest since I decided to be."
Before King David was a king, he was a shepherd boy picking five smooth stones from a stream. Why five when he only needed one for Goliath? Because he wasn't just planning to kill a giant. He was planning to kill any giant who stood against God's people. That's identity—knowing who you are so entirely that you prepare for victories beyond the one in front of you.
"The valley of Elah stretches before me. There he stands—nine feet of bronze and hatred. For forty days he's been cursing our God, and for forty days our mighty warriors have been finding excuses to be elsewhere."
"My brothers scream at me from the hillside, desperately trying to stop me from what they consider to be foolish. King Saul tries to dress me in his armor. But I can't walk in it. Because that's not who I am. I'm not a soldier. I'm a shepherd.”
"When I tell Goliath, 'You come with sword and spear, but I come in the name of the Lord,' I'm not trying to become a giant-killer. I've been a giant-killer since the day I decided God's enemies were my enemies. This is just everyone else finding out."
Ernest Shackleton led a mission intending to be the first to cross the Antarctic continent from coast to coast: "Difficulties are just things to overcome, after all."
"October 27, 1915. The sound is like God breaking the world. The Endurance, our ship, our only way home, is being crushed. Antarctica doesn't just kill you. It toys with you first."
"Twenty-seven men standing on the ice, watching our future splinter like matchsticks. We're 1,200 miles from the nearest human being. No radio. No rescue coming. Just ice, death, and me."
"This is the moment. When everything depends on the next words out of my mouth. I turn to face them, and I make sure I'm almost smiling. 'She's going, boys. I think it's time for us to get off."
"A joke. In the face of certain death. Because that's who I've decided to be—the leader who gets every man home alive. Not the leader who might save some. The leader who delivers 28 souls back to their families."
"For 22 months, that identity drove everything. When we're down to eating seal blubber, I eat less so the men eat more—but I hide it, joke about being full. When we have to risk everything on an 800-mile open boat journey, I take the five strongest men, not to survive, but to live to come back for the rest."
"May 1917. I keep my promise. Every man home. They call it miraculous. I call it inevitable. Because once you decide who you are—truly decide—the universe has to rearrange itself around that truth."
When I wrote "$100 million net worth in 5 years," the math didn't work. But that wasn't the point. The goal forced me to become someone who could create higher value. Someone who posts on social media. Someone who writes books. Someone who builds software. Your identity isn't what you've done—it's who you decide to be right now.
Principle 2 in action: Start Before You're Ready
Herb Kelleher started Southwest Airlines with a cocktail napkin 
"San Antonio, 1967. Rollin King draws three dots on this napkin—Dallas, Houston, San Antonio. 'What if we started an airline that just flew between these cities?'"
"The giants own the sky. American, Braniff, Continental—billions in revenue. We have a napkin and maybe $10,000. But there's something about that triangle. So simple it's either brilliant or insane."
"'Let's do it,' I hear myself say. Not when we have funding. Not after we study the market. Now."
"The lawsuits start before we even buy our first plane—three years of legal battles. But here's what starting does—it makes you solve problems you didn't know existed. No money for new planes? We buy 737s that Boeing can't sell. Can't afford multiple aircraft types? We become the world's expert at maintaining one model."
"All because we started with a triangle on a napkin instead of waiting for the perfect business plan."
The Wright Brothers knew about starting before they were ready. Wilbur:
"December 14, 1903. I'm lying in the sand at Kitty Hawk, staring at our Flyer—broken. Three years of work, and I put it in the dirt after three seconds."
But on December 17, Orville tried again:
"Wind's brutal—27 miles per hour. Any sensible person would wait, but the wind is why we are here. We'd stopped being sensible when we decided bicycle mechanics could build a flying machine."
"I win the coin toss. The engine coughs like it's dying. Then—impossible—I rise. Not falling. Flying. Twelve seconds. 120 feet. We're not just flying. We're teaching ourselves to fly while we're flying. No instructor. No manual. Just two brothers who started before anyone thought it was possible."
John Adams was appointed to the Committee of Five, the group tasked with drafting the Declaration of Independence 
"Philadelphia, July 1776. We have no army—just militia who go home for harvest. No navy—Britain has 270 warships. No money—we're printing currency no one trusts."
"John Dickinson stands, shaking with rage. 'You're signing our death warrants! We should negotiate, build strength, wait—'"
"'Wait?' I interrupt. 'We've been waiting our whole lives. We'll wait until we're in chains.'"
"July 4. Fifty-six signatures. Fifty-six nooses. We're starting a war we can't win because the alternative is accepting a peace we can't live with. We're declaring victory before we've won a single battle, creating a nation that doesn't exist yet."
"Outside, bells ring. People cheer. They don't know we've just picked a fight with the world's greatest military with nothing but an idea and the will to make it real. But that's how every impossible thing starts. Someone says 'Now' when everyone else says 'Not yet.'"
I learned from my Tag-Along idea not to let something sit in perfect CAD drawings without moving forward. My excavator foot? I built it with LEGOs in one afternoon. Guess which one has the potential to make money?
Principle 3 in action: Never Stop Moving Forward
Thomas Edison is one of the most persistent men in history, and his life story is a remarkable testament to the power of perseverance and resilience.
"Menlo Park, December 1879. My lab just burned down. Five years of notebooks. Gone. My assistant says maybe it's a sign to quit. Hell,' I told them, watching the flames. 'Now we can build a better lab.'"
"The newspapers mock me—' The Wizard of Menlo Park can't even light a room.' We've tested everything—platinum, carbon, bamboo, even hair from my assistant's beard. But here's my secret: I'm too stubborn to quit. Each failure teaches something. Filament 1,001 finally glows for 13.5 hours? Now we're getting somewhere. Because genius? Genius is just persistence dressed up in a lab coat."
Colonel Sanders knew about rejection:
"I'm 62, sitting in my car, staring at restaurant 1,009. All said no. Failed at everything else—lawyer, insurance, ferry boats. Now my restaurant's gone—the government moved the highway. But I get back in the car. Like I did after 1,008. Like I'll do after 1,010 if I have to. Because what else am I going to do? Quit? I've been failing longer than most people have been alive."
"Number 1,010 says yes. One yes after 1,009 nos. The difference between failure and success? Success is just failure that kept driving to the next restaurant."
Winston Churchill: "Never, never, never give in."
"Failed military commander—Gallipoli cost 46,000 lives. Failed politician—wrong about everything except Hitler. Spent the 1930s in the wilderness while they appeased a madman. But on May 10, 1940, they made me Prime Minister. Not because they want to—because they have no choice. All those failures prepared me. Every setback was a lesson. Every humiliation was tempering steel."
"When my war cabinet discusses terms with Hitler, I slam the table. 'We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall never surrender.' The Blitz comes every night, German bombers. Every morning, we count our planes. But we endure. Make jokes in the rubble. Drink tea in the ruins. Never, never, never give in."
"That's not about war. That's about life. About every moment you want to quit but don't. About every failure that teaches you to succeed. If you never stop moving forward, eventually forward leads to victory."
The Formula Applied
I believe it’s worth repeating, so here I am repeating it again. Thirty years of building has taught me that if your mindset is right and you start the thing, and you never stop pushing forward, there's nothing that can prevent you from achieving your goals.
That's it. That's the whole formula. Everything else is just noise.
-If you know who you are but never do anything, you're just daydreaming. Identity without action is fantasy, not transformation.
-If you start things but always quit, you're just staying busy. Action without persistence is motion, not progress.
-If you keep going without knowing why, you're just suffering. Persistence without identity is endurance, not growth.
When all three work together? That's when you become unstoppable. That’s when success happens.
10 chapters. Dozens of stories. All teaching the same thing: You become who you decide to be, start with what you have, and keep moving no matter what. The canal taught me persistence. El Paso taught me identity. Every business I've built taught me something. Start ugly and improve from there. Your struggles will teach you the same truths through different pains. 
That is, unless you take this book to heart! I’ve written this entire book to help you avoid repeating my failures and learn the lessons from me instead of learning them through pain. Don’t be stubborn! And certainly don’t say things like “I have to learn the hard way” (you know who you are!)
One More Builder
February 14, 1884. Everything I've ever loved is dead. Mother and wife, same day, same house. The light has gone out of my life. I sit here in this New York brownstone, surrounded by success that means nothing, holding my infant daughter who will never know her mother. I am 25 years old and finished. There is nothing left. The pain is so complete that it has its own presence in the room. I write in my diary with a shaking hand: "The light has gone out of my life." I cannot imagine tomorrow, let alone next week. Let alone becoming anything ever again.
But Theodore Roosevelt didn't stay there. He fled to the Badlands of North Dakota, to a desolate ranch where the wind could scream louder than his grief.
He decided who he was in that wilderness. Not the grieving widower. Not the failed politician. Not the weak, asthmatic boy his father worried would die young. He became someone new: "I am a man who masters himself before mastering nations."
He started before he was ready. Learned to ride, rope, and hunt. Chased outlaws through blizzards. Got knocked down in saloon fights and got back up. Lost a third of his fortune when his cattle died, but started another venture the next day.
He never stopped moving forward. Failed run for mayor. Lost his inheritance. But kept building. New York City Police Commissioner. Assistant Secretary of the Navy. When the Spanish-American War came, he didn't wait for orders—he formed his own regiment and charged up San Juan Hill.
That broken young man became the youngest president in American history at 42. Won the Nobel Peace Prize. Built the Panama Canal. Created the National Parks. Started the Rough Riders. Wrote 35 books. Gave a 90-minute speech with a bullet in his chest because "it takes more than that to kill a Bull Moose."
"I am who I decide to be" led to "Start now, not when the pain stops" led to "Never quit moving forward" led to a life that still echoes through history.
The man who wrote "The light has gone out of my life" went on to light the world. Because he discovered what you now know: If your mindset is correct and you start the thing, and you never stop pushing forward, there's nothing that can prevent you from achieving your goals.
The Timer Starts Now
The timer starts now. Not when you close this book. Not when conditions improve. Not when you feel ready.
Now.
Who are you? What will you start? Why will you never stop?
We’re Records, and Records never stop.
Now go build something.

The Only Three Principles That Matter
People collect principles like trophies while violating the only three that matter.
You've spent nine chapters learning identity, character, action, systems, connection, struggle, scale, and transfer. Important? Yes. But here's what most people miss—they're all powered by the same three-part engine. Every successful builder in history discovered this formula. David. Edison. Ali. Your great-grandfather with his pickaxe. Different words, same unstoppable force. 
Right now, you might be violating at least one: Maybe you know who you want to be, but haven't decided you already are. Perhaps you're still planning that business instead of starting ugly. Maybe you stop every time it gets hard, collecting new strategies instead of persisting with one.
Identity + Action + Persistence = Inevitable Success.
That's it. The whole game. Decide who you are and live from that truth. Start before you're ready. Never stop moving forward. Not fast forward—just forward. Everything else—the systems, the connections, the character—flows from these three. Master them and you become unstoppable. Ignore them and you become another statistic.
Your 5-Minute Action Plan:
	•	Name your violation (2 min): Which principle are you breaking? Are you living yesterday's identity? Still planning instead of starting? Quitting when it gets hard?
	•	Find your excuse (2 min): What "valid" reason keeps you stuck? What would someone with half your advantages do with your opportunity?
	•	Act before you sleep (1 min): Break one violation tonight. Declare your new identity out loud. Take one ugly action. Commit to not stopping. Write it down.
Someone with half your advantages and twice your problems is out there right now doing what you're thinking about. The only difference? They're living these three principles while you're still reading about them.
The Builder's Formula: Complete Identity + Action + Persistence. Now you have all three tools. Use them.
EPILOGUE
If you've made it this far, you've done something most people never do—you've finished what you started. That alone tells me something about who you are.
Thank you for trusting me with your time. Thank you for letting me share these stories, these struggles, these lessons learned in holes at 2 AM. Writing this book changed me, forced me to examine not just what I've built, but why it matters. My hope is that reading it changes something in you too.
I wrote this book because I believe in your potential. Not in some generic, motivational poster way. I believe that inside you is a builder waiting to create something that matters. Whether that's a business, a family legacy, a skill, or simply a better version of yourself—you have what it takes.
The principles in this book aren't just theory. They're tools I use every day, and they work. But more importantly, they're yours now. Take them. Use them. Make them better. Build something new.
If you get stuck, if you need guidance, if you just want to share what you're building—I'm here. Not because I have all the answers, but because builders help builders. That's what we do.
Remember: You are what you say you are. Start before you're ready. Never stop moving forward. 
Now go build something that lasts. —Kable

The Builder's Creed
Throughout these pages, I've shared stories and principles that shaped me. But there's one more thing—a creed I've adopted and lived by, originally inspired by Navy SEAL Chad Wright, who adopted it from the Official U.S. Navy SEAL Ethos. 
I read it every morning. Not because the words are magic, though they are powerful, but because they remind me who I choose to be before the day tries to tell me otherwise. Some days I feel every word. Other days, I read it anyway, especially when I don't feel it.
This isn't about being perfect. It's about having a standard to reach for when you're standing in your hole at 2 AM.
If these words resonate, make them yours. Adapt them. Live them. Or write your own.
What matters is having something that calls you back to who you're becoming when life tries to make you forget.

Business Survival and Generational Succession Rates in the U.S.
Introduction
This is some really boring stuff to read, that’s why I put it at the end, but I’m sure some people will be interested in the data. This section is for you!
Starting a business is challenging, and maintaining it over the years (let alone across generations) is even more daunting. A breakdown was provided that estimates U.S. business survival rates and family business succession rates as follows: out of 5 million startups each year, about 80% survive the first year (meaning 20% fail), 50% survive five years, and roughly 30% survive ten years; for family firms, around 30% of those survivors make it to a second generation, 30% of those to a third, and 30% of those to a fourth generation. In this report, we verify these figures against recent data and correct any outdated or misleading statistics. We draw on the latest data from sources like the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the Small Business Administration (SBA), and family business research institutes. Clear tables are included to summarize survival rates over time and across generations.
New Business Formation and Survival Rates
High Volume of New Startups: In recent years, the U.S. has indeed seen a surge in new business creation. For example, over 5 million new business applications were filed in 2023, a record high, with around 5.2 million more in 2024clearlypayments.com. Over the past five years, new business starts have averaged roughly 4.7 million per year, according to clearlypayments.com. This confirms the scale (≈5 million) cited in the breakdown.
Survival Rates in Years 1, 5, and 10: Data from the BLS (via its Business Employment Dynamics statistics) show a clear pattern of diminishing survival as businesses age:
About 80% of new businesses survive the first year, meaning roughly 20% close within year one clearlypayments.comclearlypayments.com. This debunks the myth that “most businesses fail in the first year” – in fact, a substantial majority make it through year one.
Roughly 50% of businesses survive to year five, implying half of new ventures have closed by the five-year mark, clearlypayments.com. This 50% five-year survival stat is a well-established benchmark, often cited by the Small Business Administration.
Around 34–35% of businesses survive to year ten, meaning about 65–66% will have failed by the end of a decade, lendingtree.com. In other words, only about one-third of businesses are still operating ten years after founding bls.gov. This is slightly better than the “30% survive 10 years” figure from the breakdown, but in the same ballpark.
To illustrate these survival rates with the scenario of 5 million startups per year, the table below shows the expected number of survivors over time based on recent percentages:
Table 1. Estimated Survival of 5 Million New Businesses Over Time (U.S. Averages)
Time After Founding
Survival Rate (Approx.)
Survivors Remaining (out of 5,000,000)
After 1 year
~80% survive
~4,000,000 survivors (≈1,000,000 failures)
After 5 years
~50% survive
~2,500,000 survivors (≈2,500,000 failures)
After 10 years
~35% survive
~1,750,000 survivors (≈3,250,000 failures)
After 15 years
~25% survive
~1,250,000 survivors (≈3,750,000 failures)
Sources: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data on business survival clearlypayments.com, summarized by the SBA and other analysts. For instance, about 21.5% of businesses fail within the first year, 48.4% have failed by year five, and 65.1% by year ten, according to the latest BLS cohort analysis lendingtree.com. These figures correspond to roughly 78.5% 1-year survival, 51.6% 5-year survival, and 34.9% 10-year survival. Only about 25% of businesses last 15 years or more clearlypayments.com.
As shown above, the math in the original breakdown is mostly on target for general survival rates – with one clarification: by year ten, roughly 65% of businesses have closed (about 35% survive), not a full 70% failure rate. This updated ten-year survival rate (≈35%) aligns with BLS data through 2023 bls.gov. The one-year and five-year figures (≈80% and 50% survival, respectively) are accurate and well-supported by current data from clearlypayments.com and lendingtree.com.
Industry Variations: It’s worth noting that survival rates vary by industry. For example, healthcare and education businesses tend to have above-average five- and ten-year survival rates (often 40%+ still alive at 10 years), whereas industries like restaurants and retail have lower survival (only ~20% at 10 years) clearlypayments.com. But across all sectors combined, the ~50% five-year and ~34% ten-year survival benchmarks hold true clearlypayments.com.
Family Business Generational Succession Rates
Passing a business from the founder to subsequent generations is notoriously difficult. The breakdown assumed a 30% survival rate at each generational handoff (Gen 1 → Gen 2, Gen 2 → Gen 3, etc.), resulting in 450,000 second-generation businesses out of 1.5 million ten-year survivors, then 135,000 third-generation, and 40,500 fourth-generation. We need to compare this to research on family-owned business succession:
Second Generation: It is commonly said that only about 30% of family-owned businesses successfully transition to the second generation (i.e. continue under family ownership/management after the founder retires) business.oregonstate.eduspecialtyfabricsreview.com. Some studies put this figure a bit higher – for instance, one report found that about 40% of U.S. family businesses make it to a second-generation business. cornell.edu – but roughly one-third is a widely cited estimate.
Third Generation: Approximately 12–13% of family businesses survive into the third generation. business.oregonstate.edu specialtyfabricsreview.com. In other words, of all family firms started, only about one in eight will still be run by the founder’s grandchildren (or third-generation family). This is much lower than the 30% figure the breakdown assumed for a second generational handoff.
Fourth Generation and Beyond: Only around 3% of family businesses make it to a fourth generation (or beyond) business.oregonstate.edu business.cornell.edu. This is an almost vanishingly small fraction – roughly 1 in 30 family firms – that continue to operate under family control into the great-grandchildren’s era.
These statistics are often summarized as the “30-13-3 rule” – only 30% make it to the second generation, 13% to the third, and 3% to the fourth. This rule of thumb originated from a 1980s study and has been borne out anecdotally over decades, business.oregonstate.edu. Recent family business surveys continue to report similar figures (e.g. ~30% to Gen 2, ~12% to Gen 3), specialtyfabricsreview.com. The implication is that each successive generational transfer is an uphill battle, with a steep drop-off in continuity beyond the founder’s generation.
It’s important to clarify that the original breakdown’s math for generational survival (multiplying 30% each time) was mathematically correct, but it assumed a constant 30% survival at each generational handoff. In reality, the percentage of businesses that endure drops at each generation, rather than staying at 30%. By the third to fourth generation, the odds of a family firm remaining in the family are only a few percent. business.oregonstate.edu. Thus, the 450,000 → 135,000 → 40,500 progression given (from 5 million startups) is more an illustration than a reflection of actual observed percentages. If we applied the more accurate succession rates to the scenario of 5 million startups, the numbers would likely be even lower by the 3rd and 4th generation (since only a subset of those 5 million were family-run to begin with, and only ~3% of family firms reach Gen 4). The key takeaway is that surviving long enough to become a multi-generational business is rare.
Conclusion
Bottom Line: The survival rate figures in the breakdown are broadly consistent with current U.S. data, with minor adjustments. Roughly 80% of new businesses survive one year, ~50% survive five years, and ~34–35% survive ten years in the U.S. (clearlypayments.com, lendingtree.com). The arithmetic in the example (out of 5 million startups: 4 million after year 1, 2.5 million after year 5, 1.5 million after year 10) is basically correct, though using 1.75 million at year 10 (35% survival) would reflect the latest BLS findings more closely than 1.5 million (30%).
When it comes to generational transfer in family businesses, the breakdown’s use of 30% survival each generation is somewhat misleading. In reality, about 30% of family businesses make it to a second generation, ~12–13% to a third, and only ~3% to a fourth business.oregonstate.edu specialtyfabricsreview.com. The math in the example (450k → 135k → 40.5k) mathematically represents a 30% carryover each time, but current family business research shows a sharper decline with each generation. In short, most businesses do not survive long term, and very few survive across multiple generations under family ownership.
By updating these statistics with authoritative sources (BLS for general survival, and family business institutes for succession), we ensure a realistic understanding: building a lasting business is difficult, and passing it on through generations is rarer still. The figures may vary slightly by source or definition. Still, the narrative remains consistent – entrepreneurs face steep odds over time, and sustained intergenerational success is the exception rather than the norm.
